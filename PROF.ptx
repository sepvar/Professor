    <acknowledgement xml:id="prof-ack">

        <p>I would like to thank Thomas More University for hiring me and providing such a interesting opportunity to develop my talents in a wide variety of directions with much support, collegiality, and camaraderie.</p>

        <p>I would also like to thank
        Robert A. Beezer (Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Puget Sound) and
        David Farmer (American Institute of Mathematics) for their hard work and guidance with the
        <url href="http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/">MathBookXML / <pretext /></url> format; and
        Robert Riehemann (Thomas More College, Crestview Hills, KY) for telling me about their existence.</p>

    </acknowledgement>

    <preface><title>Preface: Reference to FPM</title>

        <p>This document is intended to show that I not only meet the qualifications to apply for the rank of Professor at Thomas More University, but also meet or exceed the criteria in the areas of promotion criteria set forth in the Faculty Policy Manual as of the 2018-2019 academic year.</p>

        <p>The qualifications listed in Section 1202 (Qualifications for Academic Rank) are, with links to the relevant sections in my document, that:</p>
        <blockquote>
         <p><q><ellipsis />an appointee to the rank of Professor must:
			<ol label="a">
			  <li><p>hold a <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title">terminal degree</xref>,</p></li>
			  <li><p>demonstrate <xref ref="prof-teach" text="title">superior teaching ability</xref>,</p></li>
			  <li><p>show <xref ref="prof-scholarship" text="title">distinguished scholarship or exceptional creativity</xref> which is recognized by substantial professional contributions in the field of specialization, and</p></li>
			  <li><p>have a <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title">minimum of five (5) years in the rank of Associate Professor</xref>.</p></li>
			</ol>
		There are no exceptions to these criteria.</q>
        </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Beyond meeting the qualifications, I will address the quality of my contributions during my time at Thomas More by considering the categories listed in Section 1302 of the Faculty Policy Manual (Areas of Review in Promotion Considerations):</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><q>The following are areas of activity which may be used when reviewing cases for possible promotion in rank.
	<ol>
	  <li><p>Professional Recognition [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Professional Growth and Development [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Departmental Involvement [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Extra departmental Involvement in College Affairs [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Community/Church and/or Charitable Involvement [examples]</p></li>
	</ol><ellipsis /></q></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The discussion of these topics, while linked above, are included in the body of the several sections of this application, which according to Section 1303 (Review Process for Promotion in Rank) includes <q>a current <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title">curricula vitae</xref>, <xref ref="rec-dept" text="title">departmental endorsement</xref>, <xref ref="prof-recommendations" text="title">letters of support from colleagues</xref>, and evidence of <xref ref="prof-teach" text="title">teaching effectiveness</xref> and <xref ref="prof-scholarship" text="title">scholarly activity</xref></q>.  While I hope this application is sufficiently organized, I have also include the links from this section to those.
        </p>

        <p>The rest of this application will be laid out according to the Faculty Policy Manual (FPM) Section 1701, General Criteria for Evaluation of a Faculty Member.  In particular, I will address the FPM Section 1701.1 (Educational and Professional Background) in my <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title">curriculum vitae</xref>, the FPM Section 1701.2 (Effective Teaching) in <xref ref="prof-teach" text="text-global" />, the FPM Section 1701.3 (Creative, Scholarly, and Professional Development) in <xref ref="prof-scholarship" text="text-global" />, and the FPM Section 1701.4 (Contribution to College Community) in <xref ref="prof-service" text="text-global" />.</p>

<introduction>
<p>I am including some <q>Thank you</q> notes I have received over the years.  These are a reflection of the relationships I have been able to build with the students.  Some were due to extra effort on my part (such as <xref ref="f-Bokern" text="title">Mark</xref>, <xref ref="f-Rechtin" text="title">Maria</xref>, and <xref ref="f-Plapp" text="title">Bree</xref>) and others were a surprise (such as <xref ref="f-Bilbo" text="title">Tom</xref>, <xref ref="f-Tillery" text="title">Ryan</xref>, and <xref ref="f-Stadtmiller" text="title">Abby</xref>) since I did not think I was doing anything peculiar for that individual student.  While I am including all of these in the section on Teaching, some notes (such as <xref ref="f-Bokern" text="title">Mark</xref> and <xref ref="f-Rechtin" text="title">Maria</xref>) also reflect on service and will be linked from there.</p>

<p>The notes are sorted chronologically, starting with
        <xref ref="f-Bilbo" text="title">Tom Bilbo</xref> who took a physics class from me in 2012-2013.
        <xref ref="f-Engel" text="title">Ellen (Gamel) Engel</xref> was a math and physics double major from 2010-2014.
        <xref ref="f-Bokern" text="title">Mark Von Bokern</xref> requested some help to review material for a bypass exam during the summer of 2015.
        <xref ref="f-Plapp" text="title">Brianna Plapp</xref> and <xref ref="f-Tillery" text="title">Ryan Tillery</xref> were two students who struggled in my 2016-2017 physics class.  Bree often came to office hours and both passed the course and graduated in 2018.
        <xref ref="f-Rechtin" text="title">Maria Rechtin</xref> was an honors student who took the physics series from me in 2016-2017 and was the student representative on the Thomas More Board of Trustees during 2017-2018 while I served as the faculty representative.
        <xref ref="f-Stadtmiller" text="title">Abby Stadtmiller</xref> is a math-education major who expects to graduate this December.

<figure xml:id="f-Bilbo">
        <caption>During the 2012-2013 academic year, <url href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tombilbo/">Tom Bilbo</url>, the son of TMU's Becky Bilbo, took some supplemental courses at Thomas More as he prepared for a graduate program.  One set of courses was PHY 121 and PHY 122, the algebra-based physics course I often teach for the biology majors.  Tom was very curious and asked great questions.  We have also had several interesting conversations about physics and science in general. Tom has since gone on to graduate school in entomology and is a Ph.D. candidate at Clemson University.</caption>

This is a significant course load and Ellen worked very hard to be at the top of the class throughout her time.  She connected with everybody in the department and went on to a graduate program at UC.  She is now working at Advanced Testing Laboratories.</caption>

        <caption>In 2015, <url href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-von-bokern-3681027/">Mark Von Bokern</url> enrolled in our MAT program for graduate students who were interested in teaching high school.  He did not have credit for one of the junior physics courses necessary to enroll and asked to take a <q>by-pass</q> exam to show competency for the material.  During the summer of 2015, I loaned him my textbook and met with him for a few hours each week to assign specific homework problems, review questions about the relevant chapters, and work through solutions to select problems.  I separately reviewed his homework solutions, which were often clever and always indicative of dedicated attention to detail.  At the end, he passed the exam and the credit necessary was waived for his enrollment.</caption>

<figure xml:id="f-Plapp">
        <caption>During the 2016-2017 academic year, Brianna (Bree) Plapp took my PHY 121 and PHY 122 courses, the algebra-based physics sequence I often teach for the biology majors.  Bree was not a strong student and struggled with the math necessary for the course.  I encouraged her to come to office hours and helped her focus her attention.  She started the fall term very anxious about the material and her first few grades reinforced her self-image of being incapable of learning the material.  We worked on both the physics concepts and the frame of mind that allows one to be successful.  She always had a ready smile and I am very proud of the effort she put and the result she earned.</caption>

Ryan and <xref ref="f-Plapp" text="title">Bree</xref> were in the same class and connected over their common struggle.  They often came to office hours together.  While she comments on her internal attitude towards physics, I personally never really saw that expressed.  She was always willing to answer questions and put herself <q>out there</q> when I asked the class to join in the dialog about the material.</caption>

During the 2016-2017 academic year, she took my PHY 121 and PHY 122 courses, the algebra-based physics sequence I often teach for the biology majors.  During the 2017-2018 academic year, Maria was the President of the Student Government Association (SGA) and, as such, she was the student representative on the Thomas More Board of Trustees.  It was both of our first time being board members and, since we knew each other from the physics course, we were able to have some conversations about how to handle various topics and situations that arose during the board meetings.  The other reference in her note refers to her duties as SGA President.  I happened to be on the Core Assessment Committee during this time and asked to speak to the SGA members about the opinion of the students regarding the Core Curriculum.  Maria helped me gather information and provided a context for understand the broader opinion of students.</caption>

        <caption>During the spring of 2018, Abby Stadtmiller, a junior math-education major, took my PHY 141 course, the calculus-based introduction to electricity and magnetism that physics majors take in their first-year of college.  This course is required for math majors and Abby was not particularly excited to be in the course. We had some good-natured back-and-forth during class about the differences between mathematicians and physicists and her humor and laughter really helped me engage the other students, who were first-year physics majors and a sophomore chemistry major.  As an education major, Abby also had some insight into how to teach well and, while we did not discuss it often or in detail, it did provide me with an opportunity to reflect onmy teaching and to initiate conversations with the Education Department.  (See also the letter of recommendation from Dr. Haverkos.)</caption>

        <title>Recommendations</title>
        <!-- <introduction> -->
        <p>Please find attached the following recommendations.  I have listed them alphabetically, listed their relevance to my career, and linked them to and from the relevant sections of my application.</p>
        
        <p>
        <dl>
          <li xml:id="rec-dept"><title>Departmental Recommendation</title><p>The departmental letter of recommendation was written by <url href="https://www.thomasmore.edu/about/faculty.cfm?id=115">Dr. Robert Riehemann</url>
                and signed by the other full-time faculty in the department:

          <li xml:id="rec-ernst"><title>Dr. John Ernst</title><p>I have known <url href="http://www.thomasmore.edu/academics/faculty_profile.cfm?id=401">Dr. Ernst</url> since 2009 when we began working together on the Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP).  I was the Director of the QEP and he was the Assessment Coordinator.  This made good use of his skills with statistics and his background as a Social Psychologist.  We worked together in service to the institution on the QEP through 2016.  (There is more detail and context in <xref ref="ss-QEP" text="text-global">Section</xref>.)  Throughout this time, Dr. Ernst has been an adjunct faculty member in the Psychology Department.  After our work on the QEP, Dr. Ernst took a position as the Director of the <url href="http://www.thomasmore.edu/successcenter/">Thomas More Success Center (TSC)</url> and I have worked with him and the people he oversees in both my role as Assistant Dean, faculty member, and Associate Provost.  While I believe Dr. Ernst could address my contributions to service to the institution, I asked him to focus some extra attention on his perspective of my professional development with critical thinking (such as our work on the QEP and the related workshops and presentations).  Since we have both bridged the faculty-administration roles, I also invited him to address how I have developed as an administrator, if he sees it as relevant to my promotion in faculty rank.</p>

          <li xml:id="rec-garnick"><title>Ms. Erin Garnick</title><p><url href="https://www.thomasmore.edu/about/faculty.cfm?id=684">Ms. Garnick</url> has worked at Thomas More managing the More Store since 2014.  At that time the institution decided to end our contract with Barnes and Noble and begin a book rental program through Rafter, Inc.  We now run the rental program through eCampus.  During the transition from book sales to book rentals, I was the Assistant Dean of the College and ended up working closely with Ms. Garnick on helping the faculty make good use of Rafter's book system.  I asked Erin to write a letter on my behalf because she has experienced first hand the situations that I have tried to managed in my role as Assistant Dean.  I believe this speaks not only to my contribution through service to the institution, but also to my professional development as a colleague, as a supervisor, and as a member of the community.</p>

          <li xml:id="rec-haverkos"><title>Dr. Kim Haverkos</title><p><url href="http://www.thomasmore.edu/academics/faculty_profile.cfm?id=630">Dr. Haverkos</url> has been at Thomas More since 2012.  She teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in the Department of Education and won the Outstanding Teacher of the Year in 2017.  She has also been active in committee work and service to the institution.  In 2018, Dr. Haverkos accepted the position of Dean of the College of Education and Health Science.  With her extensive experience in teaching, service, and administration, I thought she would have valuable insight in reflecting on my performance in all three area of evaluation.  I asked Dr. Haverkos to address <xref ref="prof-service">service</xref>, <xref ref="prof-scholarship">scholarship</xref>, and <xref ref="prof-teach">teaching</xref> since our contributions to the institution have overlapping in all three of these areas.</p>

          <li xml:id="rec-huber"><title>Dr. Jeremy Huber</title><p><url href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-huber-6b330746/">Dr. Huber</url> has held a short-term full-time position in our department from 2017-2019.  During the 2017-2018 academic year, he was a sabbatical replacement for me in the fall and for Dr. Ryle in the spring.  During the 2018-2019 academic year, he is covering our reduced faculty presence with my return to the role of Associate Provost and our ongoing need for adjuncts.  While Dr. Huber could address my interactions in the department, I asked to him to focus some attention on the usefulness and student reaction to having the lab manual online.  This is a direct reflection of my sabbatical work during the summer of 2017 when I was translating the lab manuals from paper documents to online documents (c.f., <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/Labs/121/">PHY121L</url>, <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/Labs/122/">PHY122L</url>, and <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/Labs/220/">NSC220L</url>) to get up to speed on the software that would enable me to write <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/ConnectedPhysics/">the book</url> I hoped to start over <xref ref="ss-sabbatical" text="title">my Fall 2017 sabbatical</xref>.</p>

In this last role, he and I have worked together on a number of committees as well as the <xref ref="ss-committee" text="title">Faculty Policy Manual (FPM)</xref> project.  I have asked Dr. Langguth to focus his attention on my contributions to <xref ref="prof-service">service</xref> and to supplement this with whatever comments he feels are appropriate to my scholarship, especially in regards to my administrative development and my work in the <xref ref="ss-CT">QEP</xref>.</p>

Dr. Ryle offered to write his own letter of support addressing my contributions more broadly to the department and across campus, which he has witnessed through his personal experience and our casual conversations.</p>
