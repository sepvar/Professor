    <preface><title>Preface: Reference to FPM</title>

        <p>This document is intended to show that I not only meet the qualifications to apply for the rank of Professor at Thomas More University, but also meet or exceed the criteria in the areas of promotion criteria set forth in the Faculty Policy Manual as of the 2018-2019 academic year.</p>

        <p>The qualifications listed in Section 1202 (Qualifications for Academic Rank) are, with links to the relevant sections in my document, that:</p>
        <blockquote>
         <p><q><ellipsis />an appointee to the rank of Professor must:
			<ol label="a">
			  <li><p>hold a <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title">terminal degree</xref>,</p></li>
			  <li><p>demonstrate <xref ref="prof-teach" text="title">superior teaching ability</xref>,</p></li>
			  <li><p>show <xref ref="prof-scholarship" text="title">distinguished scholarship or exceptional creativity</xref> which is recognized by substantial professional contributions in the field of specialization, and</p></li>
			  <li><p>have a <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title">minimum of five (5) years in the rank of Associate Professor</xref>.</p></li>
			</ol>
		There are no exceptions to these criteria.</q>
        </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Beyond meeting the qualifications, I will address the quality of my contributions during my time at Thomas More by considering the categories listed in Section 1302 of the Faculty Policy Manual (Areas of Review in Promotion Considerations):</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><q>The following are areas of activity which may be used when reviewing cases for possible promotion in rank.
	<ol>
	  <li><p>Professional Recognition [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Professional Growth and Development [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Departmental Involvement [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Extra departmental Involvement in College Affairs [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Community/Church and/or Charitable Involvement [examples]</p></li>
	</ol><ellipsis /></q></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The discussion of these topics, while linked above, are included in the body of the several sections of this application, which according to Section 1303 (Review Process for Promotion in Rank) includes <q>a current <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title">curricula vitae</xref>, <xref ref="rec-dept" text="title">departmental endorsement</xref>, <xref ref="prof-recommendations" text="title">letters of support from colleagues</xref>, and evidence of <xref ref="prof-teach" text="title">teaching effectiveness</xref> and <xref ref="prof-scholarship" text="title">scholarly activity</xref></q>.  While I hope this application is sufficiently organized, I have also include the links from this section to those.
        </p>

        <p>The rest of this application will be laid out according to the Faculty Policy Manual (FPM) Section 1701, General Criteria for Evaluation of a Faculty Member.  In particular, I will address the FPM Section 1701.1 (Educational and Professional Background) in my <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title">curriculum vitae</xref>, the FPM Section 1701.2 (Effective Teaching) in <xref ref="prof-teach" text="text-global" />, the FPM Section 1701.3 (Creative, Scholarly, and Professional Development) in <xref ref="prof-scholarship" text="text-global" />, and the FPM Section 1701.4 (Contribution to College Community) in <xref ref="prof-service" text="text-global" />.</p>

<chapter xml:id="prof-teach"><title>Teaching</title>

<section xml:id="teach-narrative"><title>Narrative</title>
<introduction><p>In order to gauge my effectiveness, I will look to several sources of anecdotal evidence and hope that this will indicate the level of reflection, of innovation, and of effectiveness that I bring to my courses.</p></introduction>

<subsection xml:id="ss-effective"><title>Teaching Effectiveness</title>
<p>To begin with, I try to maintain a sufficient standard of rigor that balances covering the material at a pace that does allows as many students as possible to move forward without holding back the top students.  My approach is to move at a middle pace while reaching out to the slower students and occasionally tossing treats out to the faster students.  While I have never been able to go so fast that my best students are satisfied, I also cannot spend sufficient time for all of my students to understand everything.  Typically I try to maintain a pace that (1) keeps 27 of 30 students from dropping the course and that (2) allows students who stick with it and work hard to at least not fail the course.  After receiving a small but noticeable number of student evaluations early in my career that indicated that students thought I was arrogant in my grading, I spent a good deal of effort in subsequent years working to see comments in the student evaluations that indicates that students recognized that they got the grades they had either earned or deserved.  They felt that the grading was fair, that their grades reflected expectations, and that they had sufficient opportunity to get help.</p>

<p>The approach that works for me is to emphasize that the classroom is a dialog.  There has to be communication back and forth and it needs to come in multiple forms.  While there is undoubtedly a more concise way to express this idea, the analogy in my head is with email versus voice versus face-to-face communication.  Email only has the words you say.  Your voice is better specifically because it adds a dimension of modulation and emphasis.  Face-to-face communication is better because it adds yet another layer of body language.  The <q>email version</q> of classroom communication is when the student gets their information by passively listening to the lecture without interacting.  This is still a two-way dialog because (presumably) the student still turns in homework, which is communicating their knowledge (or lack thereof), and the faculty is still grading the homework, which confirms (or indicates) the level of understanding the student has according to the perspective of the more-experienced faculty member.  My first order of business is to make this channel of communication as explicit as possible.  This didn't make it into my syllabus until 2010 (c.f., the <url href="Syllabi/MP301SyllabusChristensenF10.pdf">Goals of MAT/PHY 301</url>, discussed in <xref ref="ss-syllabi" text="text-global">Section</xref>).</p>

<p>The <q>voice version</q> of classroom communication is when the lecture is interactive and the student is being called on and answering questions that the faculty member asks.  That is to say, students are able to recognize and respond to relevant questions according to what the instructor has (usually recently) introduced.  This is much better than the communication through homework because it is immediate feedback.  Both parties are currently engaged in processing the material and can modify the communication on the fly during the dialog.  I engage in this level of communication with my students by actively calling on individual students during every class.  I learned very quickly that students are uncomfortable with this approach, but I have not been able to find a better approach.  I tried small-group work and the learning curve for my implementation was too steep for my patience.  I tried think-pair-share and struggled to find that to be effective.  Instead, I found that students will accept being called on individually if I agree to give them an <q>out</q> when they are having a bad day.  Every student gets one (sometimes two) <q>pass</q> per class period for which they do not have to answer a specific question with no consequence.  The consequence if they continue to pass multiple times, is my sorrowful disappointment.  Usually that is sufficient to enable me to convince them to think through the problem out loud with me and the rest of the class.</p>

<p>The <q>face-to-face version</q> of classroom communication is when students and faculty collaborate to aim the direction of the dialog.  Obviously the faculty member has to maintain an awareness of the big-picture overview of the course and especially how the content of the single class period fits into that context.  What I mean is that the student has to feel comfortable enough with the classroom environment that they are willing to say, <q>Wait! I don't know how to fit that in my head yet.</q>  I engage in this level of communication with my students by first telling them that I have a hearing impairment (which has the benefit of being true) and that, as a result, I need to be looking at them when they ask a question so that I can see their lips moving.  Once I started doing this, the door it opened is that, if they are too uncomfortable to speak up about their confusion (usually for fear of being the only one) I can ask them to make a face or shake their head or somehow convey their confusion with a clear body language.  The advantage of this is that it communicates to me that they are not understanding.  If I see a couple of people doing this, then I <em>explicitly</em> indicate to them that I can see some faces and that they are not alone.  I tell them that I would like to try explaining it in a different way and ask if anybody can help direct my explanation by asking a question.  If they ask, then we can work together to come to an understanding.  If nobody asks a question, then I explicitly change my description and ask for faces again.  We then repeat the process.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the message I am trying to convey to them is that it is less about what I say and more about what they hear.  If they aren't hearing me, then it doesn't do me any good to keep talking.  The dialog that I try to achieve in the classroom is about how we can work together to get the information to fit in their ear.</p>

<p>The anecdotal evidence of classroom interactions indicates to me that if I can convince them that my primary goal is their understanding and their success, then I find that they are much more willing to open up and risk revealing their confusion so that together we can fix it.  That these anecdotes indicate that I am an effective teacher is reinforced by the <xref ref="teach-support">thank you notes in Section</xref> and by the patterns in my <xref ref="teach-evals" text="text-global">student evaluations in Section</xref>.  In the next section I will describe my development as a faculty member through the various innovations I have tried in a variety of courses.  Most of these a direct applications of the approach I attempt to implement as expressed above.  I also provide syllabi of the courses to show the pattern of development and the form of the implementation.</p>

<subsection xml:id="ss-syllabi"><title>Innovations in Teaching</title>
<p>As a tutor of undergraduates when I was in graduate school, I learned that (what I now recognize as) the <q>curse of knowledge</q> makes it feel to the knowledgable as though the best explanation is to start by providing context and a view of the forrest and then gradually working in to the example of the various trees that, together, make up the forrest.  On the other hand, students are often asked example-level questions and only feel like they understand when they can be successful at doing the examples.</p>

<p>The standard conundrum: Do you need the examples to understand the big picture or do you need the big picture to understand the examples.</p>

<introduction>
<p>I am including some <q>Thank you</q> notes I have received over the years.  These are a reflection of the relationships I have been able to build with the students.  Some were due to extra effort on my part (such as <xref ref="f-Bokern" text="title">Mark</xref>, <xref ref="f-Rechtin" text="title">Maria</xref>, and <xref ref="f-Plapp" text="title">Bree</xref>) and others were a surprise (such as <xref ref="f-Bilbo" text="title">Tom</xref>, <xref ref="f-Tillery" text="title">Ryan</xref>, and <xref ref="f-Stadtmiller" text="title">Abby</xref>) since I did not think I was doing anything peculiar for that individual student.  While I am including all of these in the section on Teaching, some notes (such as <xref ref="f-Bokern" text="title">Mark</xref> and <xref ref="f-Rechtin" text="title">Maria</xref>) also reflect on service and will be linked from there.</p>

<p>The notes are sorted chronologically, starting with
        <xref ref="f-Bilbo" text="title">Tom Bilbo</xref> who took a physics class from me in 2012-2013.
        <xref ref="f-Engel" text="title">Ellen (Gamel) Engel</xref> was a math and physics double major from 2010-2014.
        <xref ref="f-Bokern" text="title">Mark Von Bokern</xref> requested some help to review material for a bypass exam during the summer of 2015.
        <xref ref="f-Plapp" text="title">Brianna Plapp</xref> and <xref ref="f-Tillery" text="title">Ryan Tillery</xref> were two students who struggled in my 2016-2017 physics class.  Bree often came to office hours and both passed the course and graduated in 2018.
        <xref ref="f-Rechtin" text="title">Maria Rechtin</xref> was an honors student who took the physics series from me in 2016-2017 and was the student representative on the Thomas More Board of Trustees during 2017-2018 while I served as the faculty representative.
        <xref ref="f-Stadtmiller" text="title">Abby Stadtmiller</xref> is a math-education major who expects to graduate this December.

        <caption>During the 2012-2013 academic year, <url href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tombilbo/">Tom Bilbo</url>, the son of TMU's Becky Bilbo, took some supplemental courses at Thomas More as he prepared for a graduate program.  One set of courses was PHY 121 and PHY 122, the algebra-based physics course I often teach for the biology majors.  Tom was very curious and asked great questions.  We have also had several interesting conversations about physics and science in general. Tom has since gone on to graduate school in entomology and is a Ph.D. candidate at Clemson University.</caption>

He did not have credit for one of the junior physics courses necessary to enroll and asked to take a <q>by-pass</q> exam to show competency for the material.  During the summer of 2015, I loaned him my textbook and met with him for a few hours each week to assign specific homework problems, review questions about the relevant chapters, and work through solutions to select problems.  I separately reviewed his homework solutions, which were often clever and always indicative of dedicated attention to detail.  At the end, he passed the exam and the credit necessary was waived for his enrollment.</caption>

        <caption>During the 2016-2017 academic year, Brianna (Bree) Plapp took my PHY 121 and PHY 122 courses, the algebra-based physics sequence I often teach for the biology majors.  Bree was not a strong student and struggled with the math necessary for the course.  I encouraged her to come to office hours and helped her focus her attention.  She started the fall term very anxious about the material and her first few grades reinforced her self-image of being incapable of learning the material.  We worked on both the physics concepts and the frame of mind that allows one to be successful.  She always had a ready smile and I am very proud of the effort she put and the result she earned.</caption>

During the 2017-2018 academic year, Maria was the President of the Student Government Association (SGA) and, as such, she was the student representative on the Thomas More Board of Trustees.  It was both of our first time being board members and, since we knew each other from the physics course, we were able to have some conversations about how to handle various topics and situations that arose during the board meetings.  The other reference in her note refers to her duties as SGA President.  I happened to be on the Core Assessment Committee during this time and asked to speak to the SGA members about the opinion of the students regarding the Core Curriculum.  Maria helped me gather information and provided a context for understand the broader opinion of students.</caption>

<figure xml:id="f-Stadtmiller">
        <caption>During the spring of 2018, Abby Stadtmiller, a junior math-education major, took my PHY 141 course, the calculus-based introduction to electricity and magnetism that physics majors take in their first-year of college.  This course is required for math majors and Abby was not particularly excited to be in the course. We had some good-natured back-and-forth during class about the differences between mathematicians and physicists and her humor and laughter really helped me engage the other students, who were first-year physics majors and a sophomore chemistry major.  As an education major, Abby also had some insight into how to teach well and, while we did not discuss it often or in detail, it did provide me with an opportunity to reflect onmy teaching and to initiate conversations with the Education Department.  (See also the letter of recommendation from Dr. Haverkos.)</caption>

          <li xml:id="rec-ernst"><title>Dr. John Ernst</title><p>I have known <url href="http://www.thomasmore.edu/academics/faculty_profile.cfm?id=401">Dr. Ernst</url> since 2009 when we began working together on the Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP).  I was the Director of the QEP and he was the Assessment Coordinator.  This made good use of his skills with statistics and his background as a Social Psychologist.  We worked together in service to the institution on the QEP through 2016.  (There is more detail and context in <xref ref="ss-QEP" text="text-global">Section</xref>.)  Throughout this time, Dr. Ernst has been an adjunct faculty member in the Psychology Department.  After our work on the QEP, Dr. Ernst took a position as the Director of the <url href="http://www.thomasmore.edu/successcenter/">Thomas More Success Center (TSC)</url> and I have worked with him and the people he oversees in both my role as Assistant Dean, faculty member, and Associate Provost.  While I believe Dr. Ernst could address my contributions to service to the institution, I asked him to focus some extra attention on his perspective of my professional development with critical thinking (such as our work on the QEP and the related workshops and presentations).  Since we have both bridged the faculty-administration roles, I also invited him to address how I have developed as an administrator, if he sees it as relevant to my promotion in faculty rank.</p>

          <li xml:id="rec-garnick"><title>Ms. Erin Garnick</title><p><url href="https://www.thomasmore.edu/about/faculty.cfm?id=684">Ms. Garnick</url> has worked at Thomas More managing the More Store since 2014.  At that time the institution decided to end our contract with Barnes and Noble and begin a book rental program through Rafter, Inc.  We now run the rental program through eCampus.  During the transition from book sales to book rentals, I was the Assistant Dean of the College and ended up working closely with Ms. Garnick on helping the faculty make good use of Rafter's book system.  I asked Erin to write a letter on my behalf because she has experienced first hand the situations that I have tried to managed in my role as Assistant Dean.  I believe this speaks not only to my contribution through service to the institution, but also to my professional development as a colleague, as a supervisor, and as a member of the community.</p>

She teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in the Department of Education and won the Outstanding Teacher of the Year in 2017.  She has also been active in committee work and service to the institution.  In 2018, Dr. Haverkos accepted the position of Dean of the College of Education and Health Science.  With her extensive experience in teaching, service, and administration, I thought she would have valuable insight in reflecting on my performance in all three area of evaluation.  I asked Dr. Haverkos to address <xref ref="prof-service">service</xref>, <xref ref="prof-scholarship">scholarship</xref>, and <xref ref="prof-teach">teaching</xref> since our contributions to the institution have overlapping in all three of these areas.</p>

During the 2017-2018 academic year, he was a sabbatical replacement for me in the fall and for Dr. Ryle in the spring.  During the 2018-2019 academic year, he is covering our reduced faculty presence with my return to the role of Associate Provost and our ongoing need for adjuncts.  While Dr. Huber could address my interactions in the department, I asked to him to focus some attention on the usefulness and student reaction to having the lab manual online.  This is a direct reflection of my sabbatical work during the summer of 2017 when I was translating the lab manuals from paper documents to online documents (c.f., <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/Labs/121/">PHY121L</url>, <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/Labs/122/">PHY122L</url>, and <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/Labs/220/">NSC220L</url>) to get up to speed on the software that would enable me to write <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/ConnectedPhysics/">the book</url> I hoped to start over <xref ref="ss-sabbatical" text="title">my Fall 2017 sabbatical</xref>.</p>
