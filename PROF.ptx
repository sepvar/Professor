    <acknowledgement xml:id="prof-ack">

        <p>I would like to thank Thomas More University for hiring me and providing such a interesting opportunity to develop my talents in a wide variety of directions with much support, collegiality, and camaraderie.</p>

        <p>I would also like to thank
        Robert A. Beezer (Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Puget Sound) and
        David Farmer (American Institute of Mathematics) for their hard work and guidance with the
        <url href="http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/">MathBookXML / <pretext /></url> format; and
        Robert Riehemann (Thomas More College, Crestview Hills, KY) for telling me about their existence.</p>

    </acknowledgement>

    <preface><title>Preface: Reference to FPM</title>

        <p>This document is intended to show that I not only meet the qualifications to apply for the rank of Professor at Thomas More University, but also meet or exceed the criteria in the areas of promotion criteria set forth in the Faculty Policy Manual as of the 2018-2019 academic year.</p>

        <p>The qualifications listed in Section 1202 (Qualifications for Academic Rank) are, with links to the relevant sections in my document, that:</p>
        <blockquote>
         <p><q><ellipsis />an appointee to the rank of Professor must:
			<ol label="a">
			  <li><p>hold a <xref ref="CV-education" text="title">terminal degree</xref>,</p></li>
			  <li><p>demonstrate <xref ref="prof-teach" text="title">superior teaching ability</xref>,</p></li>
			  <li><p>show <xref ref="prof-scholarship" text="title">distinguished scholarship or exceptional creativity</xref> which is recognized by substantial professional contributions in the field of specialization, and</p></li>
			  <li><p>have a <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title">minimum of five (5) years in the rank of Associate Professor</xref>.</p></li>
			</ol>
		There are no exceptions to these criteria.</q>
        </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Beyond meeting the qualifications, I will address the quality of my contributions during my time at Thomas More by considering the categories listed in Section 1302 of the Faculty Policy Manual (Areas of Review in Promotion Considerations):</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><q>The following are areas of activity which may be used when reviewing cases for possible promotion in rank.
	<ol>
	  <li><p>Professional Recognition [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Professional Growth and Development [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Departmental Involvement [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Extra departmental Involvement in College Affairs [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Community/Church and/or Charitable Involvement [examples]</p></li>
	</ol><ellipsis /></q></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The discussion of these topics, while linked above, are included in the body of the several sections of this application, which according to Section 1303 (Review Process for Promotion in Rank) includes <q>a current <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title">curricula vitae</xref>, <xref ref="rec-dept" text="title">departmental endorsement</xref>, <xref ref="prof-recommendations" text="title">letters of support from colleagues</xref>, and evidence of <xref ref="prof-teach" text="title">teaching effectiveness</xref> and <xref ref="prof-scholarship" text="title">scholarly activity</xref></q>.  While I hope this application is sufficiently organized, I have also include the links from this section to those.
        </p>

        <p>The rest of this application will be laid out according to the Faculty Policy Manual (FPM) Section 1701, General Criteria for Evaluation of a Faculty Member.  In particular, I will address the FPM Section 1701.1 (Educational and Professional Background) in my <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title">curriculum vitae</xref>, the FPM Section 1701.2 (Effective Teaching) in <xref ref="prof-teach" text="text-global">Section</xref>, the FPM Section 1701.3 (Creative, Scholarly, and Professional Development) in <xref ref="prof-scholarship" text="text-global">Section</xref>, and the FPM Section 1701.4 (Contribution to College Community) in <xref ref="prof-service" text="text-global">Section</xref>.</p>

<section xml:id="prof-teach"><title>Teaching</title>

<introduction><p>I have been teaching physics and math courses for about twenty years.  While half that time has been at Thomas More, only about a third of the courses have been.  This is because in my sixth year here, I took on some administrative duties that reduced my course load.  Much of my development happened in the first third of my career and as I innovated and found techniques that worked I gradually relied more and more heavily on those techniques.  I continue to reflect on my teaching and I have both sit in others' classes as well as asked others to sit in on my classes.  By far I get more out of sitting in somebody's class for an entire semester and have done that four and about a half<fn>The last time I tried this, I asked to sit in on a course in the biology department because I am teaching the biology majors.  I was only able to keep up with the information for the about half the term because I was not doing the homework or studying sufficiently to develop a reliable understanding.</fn> times.</p>

<p>I am now in a place in my career where I am refining innovations and ideas from previous courses more than I am creating new ideas that are unrelated to the successes I have had in the past.  Nonetheless, I took the Director of the QEP role in part because I saw it as a mechanism for being exposed to entirely new ideas that could potentially revolutionize my teaching. It did not revolutionize my teaching, but it did help me reflect on what is important with a new and different light.</p>

<p>In the first part of my career, my attention was swallowed up by how I could present the content in a new and different way that would make sense to the students.  I have come to realize that there is no best way.  It depends on who you are talking to and what their background is.  I now focus, instead, on how to build communication and work with the students to together find a way to fit the information into their ear.  While I think it might be useful to provide this context, it also seems distracting from the three sections asked for in the application.  So I created a section, <xref ref="teach-phil" text="title" />, in <xref ref="app-additional" text="text-global">Appendix</xref> to explain it.  It is not necessary to read that to understand the rest of this document.</p></introduction>

<subsection xml:id="ss-effective"><title>Teaching Effectiveness</title>
<p>Ultimately, the message I am trying to convey to them is that it is less about what I say and more about what they hear.  If they aren't hearing me, then it doesn't do me any good to keep talking.  The dialog that I try to achieve in the classroom is about how we can work together to get the information to fit in their ear.</p>

<p>The anecdotal evidence of classroom interactions indicates to me that if I can convince them that my primary goal is their understanding and their success, then I find that they are much more willing to open up and risk revealing their confusion so that together we can fix it.  That these anecdotes indicate that I am an effective teacher is reinforced by the <xref ref="teach-support">thank you notes in Section</xref> and by the patterns in my <xref ref="teach-evals" text="text-global">student evaluations in Section</xref>.  In the next section I will describe my development as a faculty member through the various innovations I have tried in a variety of courses.  Most of these a direct applications of the approach I attempt to implement as expressed above.  I also provide syllabi of the courses to show the pattern of development and the form of the implementation.</p>

<p>Despite the small number of courses that I have taught over the past seven years since applying for tenure, I believe I can show a history of effective teaching. Regarding my classroom performance, I have been rated highly fairly consistently in <xref ref="teach-evals" text="text-global">my student evaluations</xref>.  On the 4-point scale, my average tends to be between 2.8 (70<percent />) and 3.4 (85<percent />).  On the 5-point scale (implemented in Fall 2013), all of my scores tend to be above a 4.0 (80<percent />).  The comments (<xref ref="t-descriptors" text="title" />) are fairly consistent and positive.  The most common comments are about my passion and knowledge-base.  The overall trend that I would like to draw to your attention is that there is a thread throughout about my interest and willingness to explain in a variety of ways and to make sure people are understanding the material at some reasonable level.  Frankly, I believe (granted without evidence) that this is the point that leads to the smattering of comments indicating that some (small) fraction of my students claim that I am either their favorite teacher or the best teacher they have had either this term or even through their entire time at Thomas More.</p>

<p>Another trend that I think emerges from the student evaluations is that while the positive comments tend to be about my ability to connect and inspire the students to put in the time and effort it takes to learn what can often be an esoteric or daunting topic (math and physics), the negative comments tend to be about classroom management.  While these comments exist throughout, they do not appear as frequently as the positive comments and on balance, based on the overall scores the student rank me, the good outweighs the bad by a significant amount.  To some extent, I think these time-management issues are due to the amount of time I have spent doing administrative work (See <xref ref="prof-service" text="title" /> for details).  Once I step back to being full-time faculty, I do not expect these comments to continue.  As evidence that students recognize the value added by my classes, I have compiled images of several <xref ref="teach-support" text="title">thank you cards</xref> that students have sent me.  These are not usually delivered at the end of the class, but rather at the end of a subsequent year when the student is graduating.  This tells me that I have made a lasting impression in their lives.</p>

<subsection xml:id="ss-syllabi"><title>Innovations in Teaching</title>
<p>As a tutor of undergraduates when I was in graduate school, I learned that (what I now recognize as) the <q>curse of knowledge</q> makes it feel to the knowledgable as though the best explanation is to start by providing context and a view of the forrest and then gradually working in to the example of the various trees that, together, make up the forrest.  On the other hand, students are often asked example-level questions and only feel like they understand when they can be successful at doing the examples.</p>

<p>The standard conundrum: Do you need the examples to understand the big picture or do you need the big picture to understand the examples.</p>

<p>I tried small-group work and the learning curve for my implementation was too steep for my patience.  I tried think-pair-share and struggled to find that to be effective.</p>

    <section xml:id="fac-evals"><title>Chair Evaluations</title>
        <p>I came to Thomas More in 2007.  At that time, Dr. Riehemann was the Chair of the Department.  He provided supportive Department Chair reviews of my work during my first three years 
                (<url href="documents/ChairEvalChristensen0708.pdf">'07-'08</url>, 
                <url href="documents/ChairEvalChristensen0809.pdf">'08-'09</url>, 
                <url href="documents/ChairEvalChristensen0910.pdf">'09-'10</url>).  
        In my fourth year (2010-2011), I became half-time Director of the QEP and taught fewer courses for the department.  
        That spring (2011), I was granted tenure and took that as a positive reflection on my contribution to the institution, including teaching. </p>
        <p>In my sixth year (2012-2013), I took over the Department Chair duties.  After that time, I do not have a Department Chair review of my work.  I also do not have a Dean's evaluation of my contribution.</p>
        </section>

    <section xml:id="teach-evals"><title>Student Evaluations</title>
        <p>I came to Thomas More in 2007, before we began using electronic student evaluations.  When we transitioned to the electronic version, there was a temporary drop off in the response rate.  Rather than provide documentation since my last promotion, I have gone back to Fall 2013, which is five years of recent documentation.  I have collected all of these evaluations into a single document so that you have the opportunity to randomly browse the comments.  Assuming this is not of interest to you, I have also provided several courses and several groupings of courses.
        <table xml:id="t-evals"><title>Links to various collections of student evaluations</title>
        <caption>On the left are some representative evaluations from courses that have more than 10 students. In order to get this level of enrollment, these do not include courses from the requirements for our major. On the right are some groupings of evaluations.  In particular, the <q>Recent Large Courses</q> are courses I taught from fall 2014 on that have more than 10 students. I've also provided a single file with all courses I have taught in the major.  These do not have high enrollment and have very few comments.  I included all of the PHY 121-122 evaluations because these are my highest enrolled courses and it gives a sense of the trajectory of my teaching.  I also grouped all the instances of the 301-302 series, which is dual listed as math and physics.  The MAT301 is listed separately from the PHY301, but they are the same class. This series was replaced with MAT310 when the curriculum was rearranged to increase the enrollment. </caption>

        <p>There are limited courses available because I have had course reductions since 2010 when I started taking on administrative responsibilities.  Although I usually taught 2-3 courses per term, the courses for the major typically are low-enrollment.  I included a file with all of the electronic evaluations that I have access to.  This includes at least one class from each of the following semesters: F09, S12, F12-S13, F13-S14, F14-S15, F16-S17, and S18.</p>  
        <p>In Fall 2013, we transitioned from scores out of 4 to scores out of 5.  On the 4-point scale, most of my scores are in the 2.8-3.5 range with one notable exception:  In Spring 2012, I taught a MAT 115 (precalculus) course and tried an innovation in the homework.  This is discussed above in <xref ref="prof-teach" text="global">Section</xref>.  On the 5-point scale, my scores are almost always above 4 and often above 4.5.  There is an occasional 3.8 for organization when my administrative duties have taken priority over my course-prep.  This is rare, but not vanishing.</p>
        <p>The comments are fairly consistent throughout the years.  At my previous institution, I had a little trouble with comments like <q>arrogant</q> or <q>sarcastic</q>.  I made efforts there to remedy that and in all of these evaluations, there is only one instance of that comment.  The comments (good and bad) that seem to form a trend are listed in <xref ref="t-descriptors" text="global">Table</xref>.  
        <table xml:id="t-descriptors"><title>Common Descriptors from Student Evaluations</title>
        <caption>This table contains what I think are the most common descriptors from my student evaluations.  These are sorted in what I interpreted as most common to least common. The <q>nothing needs improvement</q> comment is about as common as the <q>humor / joking</q> comment.</caption>

        <p>To my eye, there are significantly more favorable comments than negative comments in my evaluations.  All of these comments are reasonable descriptions.  The context for these comments is discussed further in <xref ref="prof-teach" text="global">Section</xref>.</p>

        <introduction>
        <p>I am including some <q>Thank you</q> notes I have received over the years.  These are a reflection of the relationships I have been able to build with the students.  Some were due to extra effort on my part (such as <xref ref="f-Bokern" text="title">Mark</xref>, <xref ref="f-Rechtin" text="title">Maria</xref>, and <xref ref="f-Plapp" text="title">Bree</xref>) and others were a surprise (such as <xref ref="f-Bilbo" text="title">Tom</xref>, <xref ref="f-Tillery" text="title">Ryan</xref>, and <xref ref="f-Stadtmiller" text="title">Abby</xref>) since I did not think I was doing anything peculiar for that individual student.  While I am including all of these in the section on Teaching, some notes (such as <xref ref="f-Bokern" text="title">Mark</xref> and <xref ref="f-Rechtin" text="title">Maria</xref>) also reflect on service and will be linked from there.</p>

        <p>The notes are sorted chronologically, starting with
                <xref ref="f-Bilbo" text="title">Tom Bilbo</xref> who took a physics class from me in 2012-2013.
                <xref ref="f-Engel" text="title">Ellen (Gamel) Engel</xref> was a math and physics double major from 2010-2014.
                <xref ref="f-Bokern" text="title">Mark Von Bokern</xref> requested some help to review material for a bypass exam during the summer of 2015.
                <xref ref="f-Plapp" text="title">Brianna Plapp</xref> and <xref ref="f-Tillery" text="title">Ryan Tillery</xref> were two students who struggled in my 2016-2017 physics class.  Bree often came to office hours and both passed the course and graduated in 2018.
                <xref ref="f-Rechtin" text="title">Maria Rechtin</xref> was an honors student who took the physics series from me in 2016-2017 and was the student representative on the Thomas More Board of Trustees during 2017-2018 while I served as the faculty representative.

One set of courses was PHY 121 and PHY 122, the algebra-based physics course I often teach for the biology majors.  Tom was very curious and asked great questions.  We have also had several interesting conversations about physics and science in general. Tom has since gone on to graduate school in entomology and is a Ph.D. candidate at Clemson University.</caption>

During the summer of 2015, I loaned him my textbook and met with him for a few hours each week to assign specific homework problems, review questions about the relevant chapters, and work through solutions to select problems.  I separately reviewed his homework solutions, which were often clever and always indicative of dedicated attention to detail.  At the end, he passed the exam and the credit necessary was waived for his enrollment.</caption>

Bree was not a strong student and struggled with the math necessary for the course.  I encouraged her to come to office hours and helped her focus her attention.  She started the fall term very anxious about the material and her first few grades reinforced her self-image of being incapable of learning the material.  We worked on both the physics concepts and the frame of mind that allows one to be successful.  She always had a ready smile and I am very proud of the effort she put and the result she earned.</caption>

This course is required for math majors and Abby was not particularly excited to be in the course. We had some good-natured back-and-forth during class about the differences between mathematicians and physicists and her humor and laughter really helped me engage the other students, who were first-year physics majors and a sophomore chemistry major.  As an education major, Abby also had some insight into how to teach well and, while we did not discuss it often or in detail, it did provide me with an opportunity to reflect onmy teaching and to initiate conversations with the Education Department.

          <li xml:id="rec-ernst"><title>Dr. John Ernst</title><p>I have known <url href="http://www.thomasmore.edu/academics/faculty_profile.cfm?id=401">Dr. Ernst</url> since 2009 when we began working together on the Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP).  I was the Director of the QEP and he was the Assessment Coordinator.  This made good use of his skills with statistics and his background as a Social Psychologist.  We worked together in service to the institution on the QEP through 2016.  (There is more detail and context in <xref ref="ss-QEP" text="text-global">Section</xref>.)  Throughout this time, Dr. Ernst has been an adjunct faculty member in the Psychology Department.  After our work on the QEP, Dr. Ernst took a position as the Director of the <url href="http://www.thomasmore.edu/successcenter/">Thomas More Success Center (TSC)</url> and I have worked with him and the people he oversees in both my role as Assistant Dean, faculty member, and Associate Provost.  While I believe Dr. Ernst could address my contributions to service to the institution, I asked him to focus some extra attention on his perspective of my professional development with critical thinking (such as our work on the QEP and the related workshops and presentations).  Since we have both bridged the faculty-administration roles, I also invited him to address how I have developed as an administrator, if he sees it as relevant to my promotion in faculty rank.</p>

At that time the institution decided to end our contract with Barnes and Noble and begin a book rental program through Rafter, Inc.  We now run the rental program through eCampus.  During the transition from book sales to book rentals, I was the Assistant Dean of the College and ended up working closely with Ms. Garnick on helping the faculty make good use of Rafter's book system.  I asked Erin to write a letter on my behalf because she has experienced first hand the situations that I have tried to managed in my role as Assistant Dean.  I believe this speaks not only to my contribution through service to the institution, but also to my professional development as a colleague, as a supervisor, and as a member of the community.</p>

She teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in the Department of Education and won the Outstanding Teacher of the Year in 2017.  She has also been active in committee work and service to the institution.  In 2018, Dr. Haverkos accepted the position of Dean of the College of Education and Health Science.  With her extensive experience in teaching, service, and administration, I thought she would have valuable insight in reflecting on my performance in all three area of evaluation.  I asked Dr. Haverkos to address <xref ref="prof-service">service</xref>, <xref ref="prof-scholarship">scholarship</xref>, and <xref ref="prof-teach">teaching</xref> since our contributions to the institution have overlapping in all three of these areas.</p>

During the 2018-2019 academic year, he is covering our reduced faculty presence with my return to the role of Associate Provost and our ongoing need for adjuncts.  While Dr. Huber could address my interactions in the department, I asked to him to focus some attention on the usefulness and student reaction to having the lab manual online.  This is a direct reflection of my sabbatical work during the summer of 2017 when I was translating the lab manuals from paper documents to online documents (c.f., <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/Labs/121/">PHY121L</url>, <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/Labs/122/">PHY122L</url>, and <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/Labs/220/">NSC220L</url>) to get up to speed on the software that would enable me to write <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/ConnectedPhysics/">the book</url> I hoped to start over <xref ref="ss-sabbatical" text="title">my Fall 2017 sabbatical</xref>.</p>

    <section xml:id="teach-phil"><title>Classroom Approach</title>
        <p>In order to provide a context for my evaluation of my teaching effectiveness, I am providing here a description of my approach to the classroom.  This also gives some context to the comments in my student evaluations, the most common of which are summarized in <xref ref="t-descriptors" />.
        </p>

        <p>To begin with, I try to maintain a sufficient standard of rigor that balances covering the material at a pace that allows as many students as possible to move forward without holding back the top students.<fn>My student evaluations have a few requests to speed up the class because the top students a frustrated at how much help the slow students need.  I have more requests to slow down.  I think I am generally able to keep a reasonable balance.</fn>  My approach is to move at a middle pace while reaching out to the slower students and occasionally tossing treats out to the faster students.  While I have never been able to go so fast that my best students are satisfied, I also cannot spend sufficient time for all of my students to understand everything.  Typically I try to maintain a pace that (1) keeps fewer than 10<percent /> of students from dropping the course and that (2) allows students who stick with it and work hard to at least not fail the course.  After receiving a small but noticeable number of student evaluations early in my career that indicated that students thought I was arrogant in my grading, I spent a good deal of effort in subsequent years working to see comments in the student evaluations that indicates that students recognized that the grading was fair, that the material is interesting, and that they had sufficient opportunity to get help.</p>

        <p>The approach that works for me is to emphasize that the classroom is a dialog.  There has to be communication back and forth and it needs to come in multiple forms.  While there is undoubtedly a more concise way to express this idea, the analogy in my head is with email versus voice versus face-to-face communication.  Email only has the words you say.  Your voice is better specifically because it adds a dimension of modulation and emphasis.  Face-to-face communication is better because it adds yet another layer of body language.  The <q>email version</q> of classroom communication is when the student gets their information by passively listening to the lecture with limited interaction.  This is still a two-way dialog because (presumably) the student still turns in homework, which is communicating their knowledge (or lack thereof), and the faculty is still grading the homework, which confirms (or at least indicates) the level of understanding the student has according to the perspective of the more-experienced faculty member.  My first order of business is to make as explicit as possible that this is a channel of communication.  This didn't make it into my syllabus until 2010 (c.f., the <url href="Syllabi/MP301SyllabusChristensenF10.pdf">Goals of MAT/PHY 301</url>, discussed in <xref ref="ss-syllabi" text="text-global">Section</xref>).</p>

        <p>The <q>voice version</q> of classroom communication is when the lecture is interactive and the student is being called on and answering the questions that the faculty member asks.  That is to say, students are able to recognize and respond to relevant questions according to what the instructor has (usually recently) introduced.  This is much better than the communication through homework because it is immediate feedback.  Both parties are currently engaged in processing the material and can modify the communication on the fly during the dialog.  I engage in this level of communication with my students by actively calling on individual students during every class.<fn>Comments about this show up throughout my evaluations and can most easily be found by reviewing almost any PHY 121-122 course evaluation.</fn>  I learned very quickly that students are uncomfortable with this approach, but I have not been able to find a better approach.  Some of my attempts will be discussed in <xref ref="ss-syllabi" text="title" />.  I found that students will accept being called on individually if I agree to give them an <q>out</q> when they are having a bad day.  Every student gets one (sometimes two) <q>pass</q> per class period for which they do not have to answer a specific question with no consequence.  The consequence if they continue to pass multiple times, is my dispirited disappointment.  Usually that is sufficient to enable me to convince them to think through the problem out loud with me and the rest of the class.</p>

        <p>The <q>face-to-face version</q> of classroom communication is when students and faculty collaborate to aim the direction of the dialog.  Obviously the faculty member has to maintain an awareness of the big-picture overview of the course and especially how the content of the single class period fits into that context.  What I mean is that the student has to feel comfortable enough with the classroom environment that they are willing to say, <q>Wait! I don't know how to fit that in my head yet.</q>  I try to plan my curriculum to make room for at least two of these per class period.  I engage in this level of communication with my students by first telling them that I have a hearing impairment (which has the benefit of being true) and that, as a result, I need to be looking at them when they ask a question so that I can see their lips moving.  Once I started doing this, the door it opened is that, if they are too uncomfortable to speak up about their confusion (usually for fear of being the only one) I can ask them to make a face or shake their head or somehow convey their confusion with a clear body language.  The advantage of this is that it communicates to me that they are not understanding.  If I see a couple of people doing this, then I <em>explicitly</em> indicate to them that I can see some faces and that they are not alone.  I tell them that I would like to try explaining it in a different way and ask if anybody can help direct my explanation by asking a question.  If they ask, then we can work together to come to an understanding.  If nobody asks a question, then I explicitly change my description of the topic (so that they come to understand that I am willing to explain topics in multiple ways) and ask for faces again.  We then repeat the process.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, the message I am trying to convey to them is that the class is less about what I say and more about what they hear.  If they aren't hearing me, then it doesn't do me any good to keep talking.  The dialog that I try to achieve in the classroom is about how we can work together to get the information to fit in their ear.</p>
