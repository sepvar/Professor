    <acknowledgement xml:id="prof-ack">

        <p>I would like to thank Thomas More University for hiring me and providing such a interesting opportunity to develop my talents in a wide variety of directions with much support, collegiality, and camaraderie.</p>

        <p>I would also like to thank
        Robert A. Beezer (Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Puget Sound) and
        David Farmer (American Institute of Mathematics) for their hard work and guidance with the
        <url href="http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/">MathBookXML / <pretext /></url> format; and
        Robert Riehemann (Thomas More College, Crestview Hills, KY) for telling me about their existence.</p>

    <preface><title>Preface: Organization of this Document</title>

        <p>This document is intended to show that I not only meet the qualifications to apply for the rank of Professor at Thomas More University, but also meet or exceed the criteria in the areas of promotion criteria set forth in the Faculty Policy Manual as of the 2018-2019 academic year.</p>

        <p>The qualifications listed in Section 1202 (Qualifications for Academic Rank) are, with links to the relevant sections in my document, that:</p>
        <blockquote>
         <p><q><ellipsis />an appointee to the rank of Professor must:
			<ol label="a">
			  <li><p>hold a <xref ref="background" text="title">terminal degree</xref>,</p></li>
			  <li><p>demonstrate <xref ref="prof-teach" text="title">superior teaching ability</xref>,</p></li>
			  <li><p>show <xref ref="prof-scholarship" text="title">distinguished scholarship or exceptional creativity</xref> which is recognized by substantial professional contributions in the field of specialization, and</p></li>
			  <li><p>have a <xref ref="background" text="title">minimum of five (5) years in the rank of Associate Professor</xref>.</p></li>
			</ol>
		There are no exceptions to these criteria.</q>
        </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Beyond meeting the qualifications, I will address the quality of my contributions during my time at Thomas More by considering the categories listed in Section 1302 of the Faculty Policy Manual (Areas of Review in Promotion Considerations):</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><q>The following are areas of activity which may be used when reviewing cases for possible promotion in rank.
	<ol>
	  <li><p>Professional Recognition [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Professional Growth and Development [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Departmental Involvement [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Extra departmental Involvement in College Affairs [examples]</p></li>
	  <li><p>Community/Church and/or Charitable Involvement [examples]</p></li>
	</ol><ellipsis /></q></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The discussion of these topics, while linked above, are included in the body of the several sections of this application, which according to Section 1303 (Review Process for Promotion in Rank) includes <q>a current <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title">curricula vitae</xref>, <xref ref="rec-dept" text="title">departmental endorsement</xref>, <xref ref="prof-recommendations" text="title">letters of support from colleagues</xref>, and evidence of <xref ref="prof-teach" text="title">teaching effectiveness</xref> and <xref ref="prof-scholarship" text="title">scholarly activity</xref></q>.  While I hope this application is sufficiently organized, I have also include the links from this section to those.
        </p>

        <p>The rest of this application will be laid out according to the Faculty Policy Manual (FPM) Section 1701, General Criteria for Evaluation of a Faculty Member.  In particular, I will address the FPM Section 1701.1 (Educational and Professional Background) in my <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title">curriculum vitae</xref>, the FPM Section 1701.2 (Effective Teaching) in <xref ref="prof-teach" text="type-global" />, the FPM Section 1701.3 (Creative, Scholarly, and Professional Development) in <xref ref="prof-scholarship" text="type-global" />, and the FPM Section 1701.4 (Contribution to College Community) in <xref ref="prof-service" text="type-global" />.</p>

        <p>Throughout this document, I have tried to make the Appendices be <q>data</q> sections in which I do not analyze or interpret the items listed there.  The analysis and evaluation is done in the Application section.  The final Appendix is intended to be additional information that is tangentially relevant.  That section can be safely skipped without losing the thread of the document.</p>

        <p>Please note that the online version uses the same software that I am using to create my online textbook.  I am hoping that this format lends an ease-of-use that helps you read through the document.  You may note that some links are colored and others have a dashed underline.  Clicking on the former sends you to that location.  Clicking on the latter opens a box at the end of that paragraph that pulls the relevant information to you, rather than sending you to it.  You should be able to navigate with the [<lt /> Prev] and [Next <gt />] keys in the upper right.  Please also note that your browser's [Back] button will also do what you expect.  Please also note that this software makes it easy to read on a computer, a tablet, or even your phone.  If you view it on your phone, please be aware that, when viewing my CV, you might need to turn your phone to landscape mode.</p>

        <p>I have also tried to make PDFs available for all portions of the document.</p>

    <p>While this document has been created to be easily read online, PDFs of the relevant material are also available.  Each section has its own link to the PDF as appropriate and they are all inventoried here for your convenience.  I have included the sizes of documents so that you have a sense of the relative size before you open a document.</p>

<section xml:id="prof-teach"><title>Teaching</title>

<introduction><p>I have been teaching physics and math courses for about twenty years.  While half that time has been at Thomas More, only about a third of the courses have been.  This is because in my third year here, I took on some administrative duties that reduced my course load.  Much of my development happened in the first third of my career and as I innovated and found techniques that worked I gradually relied more and more heavily on those techniques.  I continue to reflect on my teaching and I have both sat in others' classes as well as asked others to sit in on my classes<fn>See, for example, the recommendation by <xref ref="rec-haverkos" text="title">Dr. Haverkos</xref>.</fn>.  By far I get more out of sitting in somebody's class for an entire semester and have done that four and about a half<fn>The last time I tried this, I asked to sit in on a course in the biology department because I am teaching the biology majors.  I was only able to keep up with the information for the about half the term because I was not doing the homework or studying sufficiently to develop a reliable understanding.</fn> times.</p>

<p>I am now in a place in my career where I am refining innovations and ideas from previous courses more than I am creating new ideas that are unrelated to the successes I have had in the past.  Nonetheless, I took the Director of the QEP role in part because I saw it as a mechanism for being exposed to entirely new ideas that could potentially revolutionize my teaching. It did not revolutionize my teaching, but it provided a new language that continues to help me reflect on important aspects of my teaching with a new mechanism for framing the reflection.</p>

<p>In the first part of my career, my attention was swallowed up by how I could present the content in a new and better way that would make sense to the students.  I have come to realize that there is no best way (although there are many bad ways, which should be avoided!).  The <q>best</q> way depends on who you are talking to and what their background is, which not only changes from year to year, but isn't even uniform in a single classroom.  I now focus, instead, on how to build communication and I try to work with the students to <em>together</em> find a way to fit the information into their ear.  While I think it might be useful to describe my approach to the classroom in a little more detail, it also seems distracting from the three sections asked for in the application.  So I created a section, <xref ref="teach-phil" text="title" />, in <xref ref="app-additional" text="type-global" /> to explain it.  It is not necessary to read that to understand the rest of this document.</p></introduction>

<subsection xml:id="ss-effective"><title>Teaching Effectiveness</title>
<p>Ultimately, the message I am trying to convey to them is that it is less about what I say and more about what they hear.  If they aren't hearing me, then it doesn't do me any good to keep talking.  The dialog that I try to achieve in the classroom is about how we can work together to get the information to fit in their ear.</p>

<p>The anecdotal evidence of classroom interactions indicates to me that if I can convince them that my primary goal is their understanding and their success, then I find that they are much more willing to open up and risk revealing their confusion so that we can work together to fix it.  That these anecdotes indicate that I am an effective teacher is reinforced by thethank you notes in <xref ref="teach-support" text="type-global" /> and by the patterns in my student evaluations in <xref ref="teach-evals" text="type-global" />.  In the next section I will describe my development as a faculty member through the various innovations I have tried in a variety of courses.  Most of these a direct applications of the approach I attempt to implement as expressed above.  I also provide syllabi of the courses to show the pattern of development and the form of the implementation.</p>

<p>Despite the small number of courses that I have taught over the past seven years since applying for tenure, I believe I can show a history of effective teaching. Regarding my classroom performance, I have been rated highly fairly consistently in <xref ref="teach-evals" text="title">my student evaluations</xref>.  On the 4-point scale, my average tends to be between 2.8 (70<percent />) and 3.4 (85<percent />).  On the 5-point scale (implemented in Fall 2013), all of my scores tend to be above a 4.0 (80<percent />).  The comments (<xref ref="t-descriptors" text="title" />) are fairly consistent and positive.  The most common comments are about my passion and knowledge-base.  The overall trend that I would like to draw to your attention is that there is a thread throughout about my interest and willingness to explain in a variety of ways and to make sure people are understanding the material at some reasonable level.  Frankly, I believe (granted without evidence) that this is the point that leads to the smattering of comments indicating that some (small) fraction of my students claim that I am either their favorite teacher or the best teacher they have had either this term or even through their entire time at Thomas More.</p>

<p>Another trend that I think emerges from the student evaluations is that while the positive comments tend to be about my ability to connect and inspire the students to put in the time and effort it takes to learn what can often be an esoteric or daunting topic (math and physics), the negative comments tend to be about classroom management.  While these comments exist throughout, they do not appear as frequently as the positive comments and on balance, based on the overall scores the student rank me, the good outweighs the bad by a significant amount.  To some extent, I think these time-management issues are due to the amount of time I have spent doing administrative work (See <xref ref="prof-service" text="title" /> for details).  Once I step back to being full-time faculty, I do not expect these comments to continue.  As evidence that students recognize the value added by my classes, I have compiled images of several <xref ref="teach-support" text="title">thank you cards</xref> that students have sent me.  These are not usually delivered at the end of the class, but rather at the end of a subsequent year when the student is graduating.  This tells me that I have made a lasting impression in their lives.</p>

<p>To address my classroom organization, <xref ref="app-syllabi" text="type-global" /> catalogs a selection of syllabi for the courses I have taught at Thomas More College. These are fairly representative.  In addition to providing the relative weight of coursework in the grade, expectations, and policies, you will note that they include a schedule of topics. I am typically able to stay within about a week of the schedule, although I prefer to maintain a level of understanding at the expense of the schedule if I feel that the class does not generally understand it sufficiently. In the courses where the students complain about the organization, it is because I have fallen behind the schedule listed in the syllabus and have to adjust the due dates.  Nonetheless, the topics are still in the right order so that I can start my classes by asking the students what we did last time and what we are supposed to do today. Some of them will have their syllabus out already. Some of them will have checked their notes to be ready with a quick review.</p>

<p>It happens that I do not have many <xref ref="fac-evals" text="title" />, but Drs. <xref ref="rec-haverkos" text="title">Haverkos</xref> and <xref ref="rec-ryle" text="title">Ryle</xref> both have comments about my teaching.  Dr. Haverkos is in the Education Department and has sat in on some of my classes.  I also sat in on her Science Education course for one semester to better understand how pedagogy is applied.  It was during that course that I offer them the use of the video I took of my class.  The video was because there were a significant number of student who needed to miss class for an event and I had scheduled an example that I have found very helpful for students to work through.  The education students gave me some good feedback that helped me reflect on my teaching style.  Dr. Ryle, on the other hand, is in the Physics Department and was Chair for several years.  He has sat in my courses in his role as Chair and was kind enough to address both reference to our conversations about the classroom and reference to my classroom performance.  Some of his knowledge is from his direct observations and some is from the math and physics majors.  Dr. Ryle is one of the more popular faculty in the department and the students tend to gravitate towards him.  Some of our conversations have been about student comments about everybody in the department and that has also provided me with fodder for reflection on my own courses.</p>

<p>Finally, regarding effectiveness, I will add that being the Director of the <xref ref="ss-QEP" text="title">QEP</xref> has also opened my eyes to the research on critical thinking. The more I learn about the difficulty of information transfer between courses, the more I realize how important it is to be explicit about how students can connect the current information to future-unknown information by discussing the surrounding context from each course that uses that information.  Furthermore, I have been able to pick up some few techniques that allow me to help the students develop a thought process around the material that enables them to <q>think like a [physicist]...</q> (You may feel free to substitute your own discipline in the square brackets.)  I will address some of these ideas in the next section.</p>


</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="ss-syllabi"><title>Innovations in Teaching</title>

<p>While I do not innovate in every course, mainly because I am generally satisfied with how most of my courses are going, I do try to reflect on my courses as they progress.  When I do try to innovate, it does not always go well, but even then it is possible to learn and grow.  Sometimes innovations fail for complex reasons and revisiting them in a different context can provide new and different insight. For example, I tried small-group work in a class about twelve years ago.  The students came away frustrated with each other and confused about the material.  The learning curve for my implementation at that time was too steep for my and my students' patience.  On the other hand, I tried a think-pair-share a month ago and students seemed encouraged.  Apparently it is time to revisit the idea.  I mention these struggles to indicate that while I am highlighting some examples below, our entire department regularly discusses classroom development and how to connect with our majors as they step from one class to another.  <em>Hot-bed of innovation may overstate it, but I would like to take one sentence to note that with three people from our department up for promotion this year, you should have a good sense of the types of conversations that everybody in our department participates in throughout every year.</em></p>

<p>I would like to share the details of some approaches I have tried over the past several years.  As I do so, I will reference the syllabi in <xref ref="app-syllabi" text="type-global" /> and some other assorted documents in <xref ref="docs-hmwk" text="type-global" />.  In the appendix, I have sorted the syllabi so that the first five address innovations and the last two address course design (see <xref ref="ss-design" text="type-global" />); within each of these categories, the syllabi are chronological because (embarrassingly) the early ones do not have student learning outcomes and I wanted to as acknowledge my development as I worked my way through the QEP (see <xref ref="ss-QEP" text="title" />) and paid more attention to education research.</p>

<p>You may notice that some of the syllabi contain the result of developing the concepts that were discovered in the QEP.  I will start with <xref ref="syl-416" text="title" />, where I attempted to implement both the Central Question and the Fundamental and Powerful Concepts. </p>

<paragraphs xml:id="p-CQ"><title>Central Question (CQ)</title>
<p>In principle the CQ should be a question that a person might ask about the subject before they have taken the course, but which also allows one to repeatedly ask throughout the course in a way that illuminates the content by connecting it to a touchstone.  Unfortunately, for <xref ref="syl-416" text="title" />, I chose a bad CQ.  In many subsequent courses I have through this through, but I have yet to be satisfied with my choices for a good and enlightening CQ.  I have since stopped trying to incorporate it.</p>
</paragraphs>

<paragraphs xml:id="p-FPC"><title>Fundamental and Powerful Concepts (F<ampersand />PC)</title>
<p>The F<ampersand />PC are 3-5 ideas in a course which are fundamental in that they capture the essence of the field and powerful in that they enable one to understand previously-unrecognized relationships.
You may notice that in <xref ref="syl-416" text="title" />, I also chose a bad set of F<ampersand />PC.  Unlike in the <xref ref="p-CQ" text="title" />, I will point out that in <xref ref="syl-432" text="title" /> (E<ampersand />M) and <xref ref="syl-121" text="title" />, I was able to recognize some F<ampersand /> in each of these courses. For PHY 121, introducing the idea did not change the course except that I now said it explicitly.  The course was already (though only implicitly) organized in a manner consistent with this idea.  This is essentially also true for E<ampersand />M.  For Quantum Mechanics, this would take a significant reorganization of the material.</p>
<p>This implementation and organization of the course fit so well that it allowed me to create <xref ref="n-220" text="title" />, which will be discussed in the next section.</p>
</paragraphs>

<p>I will address additional work in applying the QEP in <xref ref="ss-CT" text="title" />.  It turns out that through these minor implementations, it was revealed to me that those experiences also fed into the QEP and provided the insights needed to present clearer workshops and connect with everybody who had an interested in exploring these ideas.</p>

<paragraphs xml:id="p-115"><title>MAT 115: Pre-Calculus</title>
<p>This course is taken by anybody who is not prepared for calculus, both MAT 143 and MAT 151.  The majority of these students are business majors or biology majors.  Some of these are academically mature but interested elsewhere, but many approach this class with trepidation. These students are not as extreme as the developmental math course, but are still somewhat uncomfortable with the material, self-conscious about their math skills, and expecting to have difficulty.  I had tried a similar approach in the GEC course I taught in 2007 to mixed results<fn>This was discussed in my tenure application.</fn>.  Some loved it and visited me through the next semester to let me know how they were doing in their next class.  Others were not so enthusiastic.</p>
<p>It is my understanding, based on discussions with a friend in Texas who is trained in the field of Cognitive Learning, that students do best when given only enough homework to gain proficiency. Unfortunately, this varies from student to student, especially in a beginning math course. Often the online homework can test for proficiency, vary the assignment length by student, and save me the trouble of grading, but in that case, it is difficult for me to see the details of the student thinking.  What I am trying this semester (See <xref ref="syl-115" text="type-global" />) is: 
<ol>
<li>tell the students ahead of time which section we will be covering, </li>
<li>ask them to look it over and try as many problems as they can do, and </li>
<li>start class by asking <q>Are there any questions from the section that will cover today’s section that you would like to ask about?</q> [Answer whatever questions they have, generalizing their questions to relevant issues.]</li>
<li><p>When they feel they understand it (as expressed by not having more questions), then I give them a quiz over the material.
    <ol>
        <li>The catch (their incentive) is that if they ask enough questions to fill the lecture time, then there is no quiz. </li>
    </ol></p></li>
<li><p>Then<fn>This is the innovation beyond the previous attempts.</fn> I collect the work they have attempted and grade it based on number of problems tried and <em>not</em> on accuracy.
    <ol>
        <li>Since the odd answers are in the back, they get 1 pt per odd problem attempted and 2 pts for every even problem attempted.  Both of these are independent of getting the right answer.</li>
        <li>To get a <q>perfect</q> score, they need to do all odd problems or half of the even problems or some combination that reaches that number.</li>
        <li>It is possible to score well over 100<percent /> on every one of these.  This is like having extra credit readily available and gives them a cushion against a failing exam.</li>
    </ol>
    </p></li>
<li>For the first few chapters, I ended the chapter by giving them an assignment that would be graded for accuracy before the exam.  On the most recent chapters, I decided that I had to change this to a small accuracy-assignment for every section, but (unlike the attempt-assignment) this is due after we discuss the material.</li>
<li>At the end of each chapter, there is a test that covers all of the topics, even if they haven’t been quizzed. </li>
</ol>
The point is that they need to see that they can figure it out; I am only guiding their attention. My saying it does not count as them understanding it. In this way, they all work as many problems as they need to in order to understand it. If they can’t understand the problems, they can ask until they do; but they have to ask questions if they want to hold off the quiz.  This idea is also related to the <q>flipped classroom</q> idea of making the class time be about asking the questions they need to know. It is different in that before class, they are reading the book rather than watching a video.</p>
<p>The result is that I had more people than I expected drop the class or just stop attending.  The people who are willing to try the experiment seem to like it and are rather interactive in class.  So, far the grades still have a pretty big spread, so I am not yet sure if I can rate it a success.</p>
</paragraphs>

<paragraphs xml:id="p-jitt"><title>Just in Time Teaching</title>
<p>One idea that I tried for a couple of years (and can be seen on some syllabi in the <q>Grading</q> section) is the JITT<fn>JITT = Just in time teaching in which you do a quick assessment before discussing an idea specifically so that you can modify your discussion based on the responses of the students.</fn> questions.  For this, I created a <url href="Syllabi/Quiz Sheet.pdf">quiz sheet</url>; students had their own sheet that they always used.  On the day when I wanted to ask a question, I handed their sheets out to them while they came into the room.  I asked them a question and could review the results with them to figure out which details I needed to discuss and emphasize.  I included this technique in <xref ref="syl-432" text="title">E<ampersand />M</xref> and <xref ref="syl-121" text="title" />.</p>
<p>You might notice that the true JITT is not intended to be a quiz summatively assessing their outgoing knowledge or skill, which is what is described on the syllabus.  Firstly, the JITT question is an opportunity to understand what baggage (or lack thereof) the students bring to the table. Unfortunately, I discovered that if there were no grade and no right answer, then rather than trying to help me understand what they brought to the classroom, the students lost their shame at not doing the pre-class work and only took it seriously when it because a quick-quiz (as described on the PHY 121 syllabus).  So, this became a tiny version of <xref ref="p-115" text="title" />:  We reviewed the previous question, I asked if they had any questions (although it was limited to 5 minutes unless it was an exceptionally good question), and then they answered the quiz.
</p>

<paragraphs xml:id="p-301"><title>Multiple Homeworks</title>
<p>The class <xref ref="syl-301" text="title" /> used to be taught for junior physics majors in preparation for the senior level courses.<fn>The 301-302 series has since been replaced by MAT 220 and MAT 310.  I has been about four years and we are re-evaluating the idea.</fn>  For the upper-level physics majors, the motivation is generally already present and the innovations here have been primarily in terms of developing techniques that enable the students to develop insight and deepen their skill set.

In fact, the technique mentioned above for the <xref ref="p-115" text="title" /> is an extreme version of my approach with the upper-level majors. Before I cover any material in a new chapter, I assign a set of sample problems that I think the students can figure out entirely on their own.  These are called <q>homework a</q> and are due the day I start the chapter. Then the students are given a second assignment in that same chapter that involves difficult problems that require an awareness of some subtlety, which is due by the time we finish discussing the chapter. This can be seen in <url href="Syllabi/MP301 homework.pdf">MP301 homework.pdf</url> for Chapters 2, 3, and 7.

<subsection xml:id="ss-design"><title>Course Design</title>
<p>As a tutor of undergraduates when I was in graduate school, I learned that (what I now recognize as) the <q>curse of knowledge</q> makes it feel to the knowledgable as though the best explanation is to start by providing context and a view of the forrest and then gradually working in to the example of the various trees that, together, make up the forrest.  On the other hand, students are often asked example-level questions and only feel like they understand when they can be successful at doing the examples.</p>

<p>The standard conundrum: Do you need the examples to understand the big picture or do you need the big picture to understand the examples.</p>

<paragraphs xml:id="n-220"><title>NSC 220: Anything Physics</title>
<p>My second example for the non-science majors is a course I successfully taught at my previous
institution and which has not yet taken hold here because, the one time I had room in my
schedule to offer it, I did a poor job of promoting it among both faculty and students. (See
Appendix A.2, “PHYS1400F03.pdf”.) This course would be an NSC-physics course at Thomas
More. It requires minimal algebra and touches on student interest. We spend half of the term
covering basic physics concepts such as motion, force, and energy – these might be called the
Fundamental and Powerful Concepts in the language of Nosich’s critical thinking teaching
techniques – and then, having established a common language and a specific skill set in
problem solving, we cover whatever the students in the class decide is of interest. I tell them
that it is open to their every whim, so long as they can ask it with physics-language. Examples
of topics that course has explored are: “How do traffic police figure out who is at fault in a traffic
accident?” (I brought in an Accident Reconstructionist and he independently explained the
technique using the same methods we had already learned.), black holes, relativity, nuclear
bombs versus TNT, the motion of the stars and planets, the phases of the moon, the function of
various household appliances, and weather and climate models. These are all student-selected
topics. It usually takes the students a week or two to realize that they have this measure of control over the course and in one instance the course turned into “stump the professor” in a good-natured competition that included the reciprocal game of “bluff the student”, requiring research on their part as well.</p>

<section xml:id="prof-service"><title>Service</title>

<subsection xml:id="service-within"><title>Service within the College</title>

<introduction>
<p>This section will be a little difficult to parse into the categories provided.  In my roles as half-time faculty and half-time administrator, I have had advising-like and committee responsibilities from each role.  It seems to me that in my case, it makes more sense to start with the section on <xref ref="ss-other" text="title" /> in order to provide context to the other sections. For this reason, I am going to rearrange the sections in service to the narrative.
</p>
</introduction>

<subsubsection xml:id="ss-other"><title>Other Service Activities</title>

<introduction><p>You may note from my <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title" /> that I started accepting half-time administrative roles in 2010, when I threw my name in the ring for the position of Director of the QEP.  When the position was offered to me, I made the commitment to serve through the fifth-year SACS-COC report, which I did.  In the middle of this commitment, we hired a new president, which led to my accepting a position as Assistant Dean.  While these situations will become more clear below, I should indicate that I believe that accepting each of these roles was mostly for the good of the institution and to the detriment to the department.  The other faculty have had to shoulder a significant portion of the load that I neglected in taking these positions and for that I am grateful to them.</p>

<p>While this section is fairly long, I think it would be useful to provide some context about my experiences prior to Thomas More University.  To that end, I have added a short narrative about my <xref ref="app-add-context" text="title" /> that is relevant to my accepting the role of Assistant Dean.</p>
</introduction>

<paragraphs xml:id="ss-QEP"><title>Director of the Quality Enhancement Plan</title>
<p>I came to Thomas More in the fall of 2007 after having built up some administrative experience at my previous institution.  There were aspects of that experience that I found rewarding even though I was not yet convinced that it was a role that I would strive for.  When the discussion about a topic for Thomas More's Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP) came up, I vocally argued for critical thinking.  I felt that my voice had some small sway in the polls and, when asked to throw my hat in, I decided to take the opportunity. I started my role as the Director of the QEP in 2010-2011 and kept the half-time position through the 2016-2017 academic year.  Virtually all of this time was after my most recent promotion/tenure application with was due in November of 2010, resulting in my tenure being granted in the spring of 2011.</p>
<p>My duties as a half-time Director of the QEP included: overseeing the implementation of the QEP, managing the QEP budget, work with the Assessment Coordinator to ensure appropriate assessment is done, supervise faculty development, promote student awareness, prepare annual reports, promote faculty involvement (as <q>3D</q>-cohorts who will Discover, Develop, and Deliver), design the 3D-cohort meeting structure, facilitate the 3D-community, design and structure the 3D success and scholarship, and oversee the QEP library resources.  During this time, I had extensive help from the QEP Assessment Coordinator, Dr. John Ernst, who I have asked to write a <xref ref="rec-ernst" text="title">letter of recommendation</xref>.</p>
<p>The skills and knowledge required for this job were, in order of relevance, self-motivation, independent oversight of 8-10 individuals who had their own ideas of how things ought to be done and who changed every year, cajoling colleagues to participate, develop and maintain a working knowledge of both pedagogy and critical thinking techniques at a level sufficient not only to implement, but also to train the faculty who would be implementing these techniques, and to maintain a budget.</p>
<p>During the <q>zeroth</q> year of the QEP (2010-2011), the cohort had to literally discover and develop the critical thinking knowledge base across campus and figure out how to deliver this to the campus community, including not only the students in their class (although that was the initial focus), but also the faculty colleagues across campus in any and all disciplines.  This group remained as a cohort during the first year to implement the previous discoveries.  There were then four additional cohorts, lasting through 2015-2016.  During the 2016-2017 academic year, I remained the Director of the QEP as a quarter-time position to manage the transition as we investigated how to make a Center for Teaching and Learning, to maintain whatever support I could for faculty who continue to implement the critical thinking techniques, and to write the QEP section of the SACS-COC fifth-year report.  This report was required to include a quantitative assessment the five years of implementation, with data, all within ten pages.</p>
<p>The process of this work lead to several scholarship opportunities, which I will discuss in <xref ref="ss-CT" text="title" />. These opportunities and the work I did with colleagues also influenced my teaching, which I discuss in <xref ref="ss-syllabi" text="title" />.</p>
<p>The result of this endeavor was that <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/JChristensen/documents/SACS-COC Response to Fifth Year Report (scan).pdf">SACS-COC accepted the QEP Impact Report with no findings (see page 2)</url>.  This is an outstanding endorsement of all of the hard work that the nearly fifty full- and part-time faculty invested in this process.  I am very proud to have been a part of this activity.  I believe, and have the assessment to support, that the process had a positive impact on the campus and has enhanced many faculty members' teaching implementation across campus.</p>

<paragraphs xml:id="ss-AssD"><title>Assistant Dean</title>
<p>I came to Thomas More in the fall of 2007 after having been at McMurry University for eight years.  During my time at McMurry, I had built up some administrative experience during a tumultuous time there.  In 2013, Thomas More hired President Armstrong, who saw his mandate as being a change-agent.  For various reasons, in the spring of 2014, the previous VPAA / Dean of the College left our institution and he was replaced with Dr. Wolper.  Among some other changes taking place, this caused some disruption and, in an attempt to seed peace, President Armstrong offered the faculty a new administrative position of Assistant Dean of the College which would be selected from among the faculty and recommended by the faculty as a body.  Several names were put forth and, based on my prior experience (c.f., <xref ref="app-add-context" text="type-global" />), I was chosen from among them.</p>
<p>I served for one year under Dr. Wolper and we worked well together, but had to figure out the details of what needed to be done since there was no previous administrator who could provide direction.  My role in this was primarily to help the administration understand the culture of the faculty and help the faculty understand the goals of the administration.</p>
</paragraphs>

<paragraphs xml:id="ss-AssP"><title>Associate Provost</title>

</subsubsection>

<subsubsection xml:id="ss-committee"><title>Committee Work</title>
<p>I have served on many committees and these are detailed on my <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title" />.  Some of these are in my capacity as a faculty member.  In other cases I was either <foreign>ex officio</foreign> or guest.  An extreme example of the complications not captured in the CV is the CAC. During my first year, I was there as a faculty member, then my role became the QEP representative.  Once I became Assistant Dean, I was replaced with Dr. Ernst as the QEP representative.  Shortly thereafter, I was put back on that committee as the representative of the Dean's office.  Independent of the representation issue, I am proud of the efforts of the committee to tackle the complex issue of reconsidering the core curriculum.  Because developing a curriculum is about more than selecting the appropriate courses, we began by developing the student outcomes and then set to the task of using those outcomes as a guide for selecting courses that would enable our students to reach the goals of our curriculum.  While I was by no means the sole contributor to this committee, I think any of those members would agree that I carried at least my fair share of the effort in bringing these ideas forward to the faculty.</p>
<p>For a second example of my contributions, in my role as first Assistant Dean and now the Associate Provost, I have served as a guest in FCC and Academic Affairs where my role is to be a resource for the committee whenever they are deliberating an issue.</p>
<p>A third example that I would like to highlight is my effort with the book-rental programs.  Working through the various issues that arose took diplomacy, a sense of calm, an ability to collaborate and problem solve, and an awareness of serving multiple, competing goals for the program.  I think I contributed significantly to enabling this program to the benefit of many students and the repair of difficulties some faculty faced.  This effort was significant enough that I thought it would be appropriate to ask <xref ref="rec-garnick" text="title" /> for a letter of recommendation, which she graciously agreed to do.</p>
<p>While there are other committees I could discuss, the committee work I am most proud of is that of the revisions to the Faculty Policy Manual.  The committee is in charge of reviewing the changes made by Stephen Lazarus and comparing it to our culture at Thomas More.  This committee has met during the spring and throughout the summer as well as into the fall.  I have been the recorder during this time.  My role has been in tracking the conversation during the meetings and then translating that into recommendations for Stephen Lazarus to consider when he edits the document.</p>
<p>In general, my CV also indicates the positions I held on those committees.  Throughout this there have also been meetings between staff departments, such as the START committee, which bring together representatives from Student Life, the Academic Dean, Security, Financial Aid, Admissions, Athletics, Religious Life, HR, Counseling, etc. to coordinate efforts and figure out how to best support the students and the broader Thomas More Community.  My strongest take away from this experience has also been the strongest driving factor in my desire to contribute in service to the institution: that we belong to an academic community that is driven to support not only each other, but the students who pass through, contribute, and are changed by their experience here.  I say this to highlight the comments that <xref ref="rec-ryle" text="title" /> ended his recommendation with. I am able to support individuals specifically because I feel the support of the broader community through this committee structure.</p>

</subsubsection>

<subsubsection xml:id="ss-advising"><title>Counseling and Advising</title>
<p>Over the past decade I have retained some advisees, but, since I have been half-time faculty, I have only covered about half to two-thirds as many advisees as the others in the department.  This year, I have taken on a few more and most of them first-year students because my current advisees are set to graduate soon.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in my capacity as Assistant Dean and now as Provost, one of my jobs has been to handle student problems that impact the classroom.  Some of these have been medical issues.  Some have been student complaints about faculty.  Some of these have been faculty submitting academic violations.  Throughout the years, my goal has been to hear both sides, mediate the conversation so that both sides not only feel heard, but come together to a solution that is acceptable and reasonable.  I think I have contributed significantly in this regard, but I do not have an accurate count of the number of students and faculty that I have interacted in this regard.  I would estimate that the numbers were around five each year while I was Assistant Dean and around ten as Associate Provost.  The difference in the latter seems to be an increasing number of students with clinically treated anxiety.  While these numbers are small, they don't get to the Dean's office unless they are pretty severe or sensitive.  Often a parent is involved.  Sometimes the President is involved.  Many times there are issues that affect the student's financial aid or possibly impact whether or not the student will be lost to higher education for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>One last thought that I will include here, although I don't think it falls under the original intent of the category.  At least half of my job as the Director of the QEP was about serving and supporting faculty as they evaluated their classrooms.  I did not think to ask for a letter of recommendation about this specific topic, but I think most of the faculty who participated in the QEP will attest, a significant fraction of <q>supporting the faculty</q> was expressed through hashing out ideas and offering advice and feedback to them as individuals.  This was, I think, my most significant contribution to the community from my time in the QEP.</p>

<subsection xml:id="service-without"><title>Service outside of the College</title>
<p>In the early years of my career, prior to earning tenure at Thomas More, I was active in areas beyond the institution.  Some of these are listed on my <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title" /> under <q>Community</q> and <q>Interests</q>.  However, once I found the need for service within our own community and that I could address it in my position as Director of the QEP and as the Assistant Dean, I gradually pulled my attention away from those efforts and towards campus activities.  Consequently, this category has very few entries.  Nonetheless, I can point out a few items from my CV.</p>
<p>First, you may note under <q>Presentations</q> that there is a section on the professional development for regional high school teachers through the TSI program.  While this is a contribution within the College, it has broad impact beyond the institution.  Similarly, the TSI and Adventure Camps impact the regional high school and grade school students.  The items listed under <q>Invited Talks and Public Lectures</q> also allow me to use my professional expertise to (hopefully) enhance the lives and outlook of the broader community.</p>

        <appendix xml:id="app-syllabi"><title>Syllabi</title>
        <p>This section includes eight syllabi, six of which will be used to address innovations and development.  Two will be used to address new courses designed and revised.  I will list them chronologically within each category and discuss the first six in <xref ref="ss-syllabi" text="title" /> and the last two in <xref ref="ss-design" text="title" />.

                        <p>In this upper-level course for physics majors, I list a detailed schedule so that student can prepare for class beforehand.  At this point, I was including the Department goals, but not the student learning outcomes.  This is the first semester I started including the language of <xref ref="teach-phil" text="title">being in dialog</xref> with the students.  (See also <xref ref="hmwk-301" text="title" />.)</p>

                        <p>In this upper-level course for physics majors, I list a detailed schedule so that student can prepare for class beforehand.  At this point, I had been the Director of the <xref ref="ss-QEP" text="title">QEP</xref>, learning some new concepts and interested in trying them in my classes.  In this class, you can see that I introduced the idea of a <term>Central Question (CQ)</term> and integrated the idea of <term>Fundamental and Powerful Concepts (F<ampersand />PC)</term>.  I continue to include the language of <xref ref="teach-phil" text="title">being in dialog</xref> with the students.</p>

                        <p>At this point, I had been the Director of the <xref ref="ss-QEP" text="title">QEP</xref> for several years and I am making other modifications. In this upper-level course for physics majors, I still list a detailed schedule so that student can prepare for class beforehand.  I continue to include the language of <xref ref="teach-phil" text="title">being in dialog</xref> with the students; but added language about <em>recognizing</em> versus <em>understanding</em>.)  In addition I added (to Departmental Goals) the Goals of the Instructor, which include the F<ampsersand />PC.  I also added a section of the impact of these goals on my expectations of my student; these include the <term>student learning outcomes (SLO)</term>. I am also including a <term>Just in Time Teaching (JITT)</term> question.</p>

                        <p>At this point, I am ending my term as the Director of the <xref ref="ss-QEP" text="title">QEP</xref>. This lower-level course is designed as a service course for the biology majors, I still list a detailed schedule so that student can prepare for class beforehand.  Here, almost all of the features from the 2013 syllabus continue to exist, but I have shifted the SLOs to their own subsection. In this semester, I bagged the JITT, but I did introduce a 10-minute quiz halfway between the exam.</p>

                        <p>This lower-level math course is designed for those students who are not ready for calculus.  These are generally students who are good at their major, but struggle a bit with mathematics. This is evidence of settling into a pattern of techniques that seem to work well for me, but with an innovation in the homework.</p>

                        <p>This is a three credit hour course that I designed as a core requirement for students who are physics-curious, but math-phobic.  It includes goals, outcomes, and a schedule.  The schedule in this case is flexible.  This course makes use of the F<ampersand />PC mentioned above, but takes it to a new level by allowing students to choose their own topics for the back half of the semester.

        <appendix><title>Teaching Documentation</title>

    <section xml:id="fac-evals"><title>Chair Evaluations</title>
        <p>I came to Thomas More in 2007.  At that time, Dr. Riehemann was the Chair of the Department.  He provided supportive Department Chair reviews of my work during my first three years
                (<url href="documents/ChairEvalChristensen0708.pdf">'07-'08</url>,
                <url href="documents/ChairEvalChristensen0809.pdf">'08-'09</url>,
                <url href="documents/ChairEvalChristensen0910.pdf">'09-'10</url>).
        In my fourth year (2010-2011), I became half-time Director of the QEP and taught fewer courses for the department.
        That spring (2011), I was granted tenure and took that as a positive reflection on my contribution to the institution, including teaching. </p>
        <p>In my sixth year (2012-2013), I took over the Department Chair duties.  After that time, I do not have a Department Chair review of my work.  I also do not have a Dean's evaluation of my contribution.</p>
        </section>

    <section xml:id="teach-evals"><title>Student Evaluations</title>
        <p>I came to Thomas More in 2007, before we began using electronic student evaluations.  When we transitioned to the electronic version, there was a temporary drop off in the response rate.  Rather than provide documentation since my last promotion, I have gone back to Fall 2013, which is five years of recent documentation.  I have collected all of these evaluations into a single document so that you have the opportunity to randomly browse the comments.  Assuming this is not of interest to you, I have also provided several courses and several groupings of courses.
        <table xml:id="t-evals"><title>Links to various collections of student evaluations</title>
        <caption>On the left are some representative evaluations from courses that have more than 10 students. In order to get this level of enrollment, these do not include courses from the requirements for our major. On the right are some groupings of evaluations.  In particular, the <q>Recent Large Courses</q> are courses I taught from fall 2014 forward that have more than 10 students. I've also provided a single file with all courses I have taught in the major.  These do not have high enrollment and have very few comments.  I included all of the PHY 121-122 evaluations because these are my highest enrolled courses and it gives a sense of the trajectory of my teaching.  I also grouped all the instances of the 301-302 series, which is dual listed as math and physics.  The MAT301 is listed separately from the PHY301, but they are the same class. This series was replaced with MAT310 when the curriculum was rearranged to increase the enrollment. </caption>

        </table></p>
        <p>There are limited courses available because I have had course reductions since 2010 when I started taking on administrative responsibilities.  Although I usually taught 2-3 courses per term, the courses for the major typically are low-enrollment.  I included a file with all of the electronic evaluations that I have access to.  This includes at least one class from each of the following semesters: F09, S12, F12-S13, F13-S14, F14-S15, F16-S17, and S18<fn>Note that in the Fall of 2017, I was on sabbatical and taught no courses.</fn>.</p>
        <p>In Fall 2013, we transitioned from scores out of 4 to scores out of 5.  On the 4-point scale, most of my scores are in the 2.8-3.5 range with one notable exception:  In Spring 2012, I taught a MAT 115 (precalculus) course and tried an innovation in the homework.  This is discussed above in <xref ref="ss-syllabi" text="type-global" />.  On the 5-point scale, my scores are almost always above 4 and often above 4.5.  There is an occasional 3.8 for organization when my administrative duties have taken priority over my course-prep.  This is rare, but not vanishing.</p>
        <p>The comments are fairly consistent throughout the years.  At my previous institution, I had a little trouble with comments like <q>arrogant</q> or <q>sarcastic</q>.  I made efforts there to remedy that and in all of these evaluations, there is only one isolated instance of that comment.  The comments (good and bad) that seem to form a trend are listed in <xref ref="t-descriptors" text="type-global" />.
        <table xml:id="t-descriptors"><title>Common Descriptors from Student Evaluations</title>
        <caption>This table contains what I think are the most common descriptors from my student evaluations.  These are sorted in what I interpreted as most common to least common. The <q>nothing needs improvement</q> comment is about as common as the <q>humor / joking</q> comment.</caption>

        <p>To my eye, there are significantly more favorable comments than negative comments in my evaluations.  All of these comments are reasonable descriptions.  The context for these comments is discussed further in <xref ref="ss-effective" text="type-global" />.</p>

<section xml:id="teach-support"><title>Testimonials</title>

        <introduction>
        <p>I am including some <q>Thank you</q> notes I have received over the years.  These are a reflection of the relationships I have been able to build with the students.  Some were due to extra effort on my part (such as <xref ref="f-Bokern" text="title">Mark</xref>, <xref ref="f-Rechtin" text="title">Maria</xref>, and <xref ref="f-Plapp" text="title">Bree</xref>) and others were a surprise (such as <xref ref="f-Bilbo" text="title">Tom</xref>, <xref ref="f-Tillery" text="title">Ryan</xref>, and <xref ref="f-Stadtmiller" text="title">Abby</xref>) since I did not think I was doing anything peculiar for that individual student.  While I am including all of these in the section on Teaching, some notes (such as <xref ref="f-Bokern" text="title">Mark</xref> and <xref ref="f-Rechtin" text="title">Maria</xref>) also reflect on service and will be linked from there.</p>

        <p>The notes are sorted chronologically, starting with
                <xref ref="f-Bilbo" text="title">Tom Bilbo</xref> who took a physics class from me in 2012-2013.
                <xref ref="f-Engel" text="title">Ellen (Gamel) Engel</xref> was a math and physics double major from 2010-2014.
                <xref ref="f-Bokern" text="title">Mark Von Bokern</xref> requested some help to review material for a bypass exam during the summer of 2015.
                <xref ref="f-Plapp" text="title">Brianna Plapp</xref> and <xref ref="f-Tillery" text="title">Ryan Tillery</xref> were two students who struggled in my 2016-2017 physics class.  Bree often came to office hours and both passed the course and graduated in 2018.
                <xref ref="f-Rechtin" text="title">Maria Rechtin</xref> was an honors student who took the physics series from me in 2016-2017 and was the student representative on the Thomas More Board of Trustees during 2017-2018 while I served as the faculty representative.

                <caption>During the spring of 2018, Abby Stadtmiller, a junior math-education major, took my PHY 141 course, the calculus-based introduction to electricity and magnetism that physics majors take in their first-year of college.  This course is required for math majors and Abby was not particularly excited to be in the course. We had some good-natured back-and-forth during class about the differences between mathematicians and physicists and her humor and laughter really helped me engage the other students, who were first-year physics majors and a sophomore chemistry major.  As an education major, Abby also had some insight into how to teach well and, while we did not discuss it often or in detail, it did provide me with an opportunity to reflect on my teaching and to initiate conversations with the Education Department.

        <!-- <introduction> -->
        <p>Please find attached the following recommendations.  I have listed them alphabetically, listed their relevance to my career, and linked them to and from the relevant sections of my application.</p>

          <li xml:id="rec-ernst"><title>Dr. John Ernst</title><p>I have known <url href="http://www.thomasmore.edu/academics/faculty_profile.cfm?id=401">Dr. Ernst</url> since 2010 when we began working together on the Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP).  I was the Director of the QEP and he was the Assessment Coordinator.  This made good use of his skills with statistics and his background as a Social Psychologist.  We worked together in service to the institution on the QEP through 2016.  (There is <xref ref="ss-QEP" text="title">more detail and context</xref> in <xref ref="ss-other" text="type-global" />.)  Throughout this time, Dr. Ernst has been an adjunct faculty member in the Psychology Department.  After our work on the QEP, Dr. Ernst took a position as the Director of the <url href="http://www.thomasmore.edu/successcenter/">Thomas More Success Center (TSC)</url> and I have worked with him and the people he oversees in both my role as <xref ref="ss-AssD" text="title">Assistant Dean</xref>, faculty member, and <xref ref="ss-AssP" text="title">Associate Provost</xref>.  While I believe Dr. Ernst could address my contributions to service to the institution, I asked him to focus some extra attention on his perspective of my professional development and scholarship with critical thinking (such as our work on the QEP and the related workshops and presentations).  Since we have both bridged the faculty-administration roles, I also invited him to address how I have developed as an administrator, if he sees it as relevant to my promotion in faculty rank.</p>

At that time the institution decided to end our contract with Barnes and Noble and begin a book rental program through Rafter, Inc.  We now run the rental program through eCampus.  During the transition from book sales to book rentals, I was the Assistant Dean of the College and ended up working closely with Ms. Garnick on helping the faculty make good use of Rafter's book system.  I asked Erin to write a letter on my behalf because she has experienced first hand the situations that I have tried to managed in my role as Assistant Dean.  I believe this speaks not only to my contribution through service to the institution, but also to my professional development as a colleague, as a supervisor, and as a member of the community.</p>

She teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in the Department of Education and won the Outstanding Teacher of the Year in 2017.  She has also been active in committee work and service to the institution.  In 2018, Dr. Haverkos accepted the position of Dean of the College of Education and Health Science.  With her extensive experience in teaching, service, and administration, I thought she would have valuable insight in reflecting on my performance in all three areas of evaluation.  I asked Dr. Haverkos to address <xref ref="prof-service">service</xref>, <xref ref="prof-scholarship">scholarship</xref>, and <xref ref="prof-teach">teaching</xref> since our contributions to the institution have overlapping in all three of these areas.</p>

During the 2018-2019 academic year, he is covering our reduced faculty presence with my return to the role of Associate Provost and our ongoing need for adjuncts.  While Dr. Huber could speak to my interactions in the department, I asked to him to focus some attention on the usefulness and student reaction to having the lab manual online.  This is a direct reflection of my sabbatical work during the summer of 2017 when I was translating the lab manuals from paper documents to online documents (c.f., <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/Labs/121/">PHY121L</url>, <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/Labs/122/">PHY122L</url>, and <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/Labs/220/">NSC220L</url>) to get up to speed on the software that would enable me to write <url href="http://physics.thomasmore.edu/ConnectedPhysics/">the book</url> I hoped to start during <xref ref="ss-sabbatical" text="title">my Fall 2017 sabbatical</xref>.

        <appendix xml:id="app-additional"><title>Additional Information</title>

    <section xml:id="teach-phil"><title>Classroom Approach</title>
        <p>In order to provide a context for my evaluation of my teaching effectiveness, I am providing here a description of my approach to the classroom.  This also gives some context to the comments in my student evaluations, the most common of which are summarized in <xref ref="t-descriptors" text="type-global" />.
        </p>

        <p>To begin with, I try to maintain a sufficient standard of rigor that balances covering the material at a pace that allows as many students as possible to move forward without holding back the top students.  My student evaluations have a few requests to speed up the class because the top students a frustrated at how much help the slow students need.  I have more requests to slow down.  I think I am generally able to keep a reasonable balance. </p>

        <p>The approach that works for me is to emphasize that the classroom is a dialog.  There has to be communication back and forth and it needs to come in multiple forms.  While there is undoubtedly a more concise way to express this idea, the analogy in my head is with email versus voice versus face-to-face communication.  Email only has the words you say.  Your voice is better specifically because it adds a dimension of modulation and emphasis.  Face-to-face communication is better because it adds yet another layer of body language.  The <q>email version</q> of classroom communication is when the student gets their information by passively listening to the lecture with limited interaction.  This is still a two-way dialog because (presumably) the student still turns in homework, which is communicating their knowledge (or lack thereof), and the faculty is still grading the homework, which confirms (or at least indicates) the level of understanding the student has according to the perspective of the more-experienced faculty member.  My first order of business is to make as explicit as possible that this is a channel of communication.  This didn't make it into my syllabus until 2010 (c.f., the <url href="Syllabi/MP301SyllabusChristensenF10.pdf">Goals of MAT/PHY 301</url>, discussed in <xref ref="ss-syllabi" text="type-global" />).</p>

        <p>The <q>voice version</q> of classroom communication is when the lecture is interactive and the student is being called on and answering the questions that the faculty member asks.  That is to say, students are able to recognize and respond to relevant questions according to what the instructor has (usually recently) introduced.  This is much better than the communication through homework because it is immediate feedback.  Both parties are currently engaged in processing the material and can modify the communication on the fly during the dialog.  I engage in this level of communication with my students by actively calling on individual students during every class.<fn>Comments about this show up throughout my evaluations and can most easily be found by reviewing almost any PHY 121-122 course evaluation.</fn>  I learned very quickly that students are uncomfortable with this approach, but I have not been able to find a better one.  Some of my attempts will be discussed in <xref ref="ss-syllabi" text="title" />.  I found that students will accept being called on individually if I agree to give them an <q>out</q> when they are having a bad day.  Every student gets one (sometimes two) <q>pass</q> per class period for which they do not have to answer a specific question with no consequence.  The consequence if they continue to pass multiple times, is my dispirited disappointment.  Usually that is sufficient to enable me to convince them to think through the problem out loud with me and the rest of the class.</p>

        <p>The <q>face-to-face version</q> of classroom communication is when students and faculty collaborate to aim the direction of the dialog.  Obviously the faculty member has to maintain an awareness of the big-picture overview of the course and especially how the content of the single class period fits into that context.  What I mean is that the student has to feel comfortable enough with the classroom environment that they are willing to say, <q>Wait! I don't know how to fit that in my head yet.</q>  I try to plan my curriculum to make room for at least two of these per class period.  I engage in this level of communication with my students by first telling them that I have a hearing impairment (which has the benefit of being true) and that, as a result, I need to be looking at them when they ask a question so that I can see their lips moving.  Once I started doing this, the door it opened is that, if they are too uncomfortable to speak up about their confusion (usually for fear of being the only one) I can ask them to make a face or shake their head or somehow convey their confusion with some body language that can be seen by, although it might not be seen by others in the class.  The advantage of this is that it communicates to me that they are not understanding.  If I see a couple of people doing this, then I <em>explicitly</em> indicate to them that I can see some faces and that they are not alone.  I tell them that I would like to try explaining it in a different way and ask if anybody can help direct my explanation by asking a question.  If they ask, then we can work together to come to an understanding.  If nobody asks a question, then I explicitly change my description of the topic (so that they come to understand that I am willing to explain topics in multiple ways) and ask for faces again.  We then repeat the process.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, the message I am trying to convey to them is that the class is less about what I say and more about what they hear.  If they aren't hearing me, then it doesn't do me any good to keep talking.  The dialog that I try to achieve in the classroom is about how we can work together to get the information to fit in their ear.</p>

        <section xml:id="app-add-context"><title>Administrative experiences at McMurry University</title>
        <p>For context to my comments below, I would like to comment briefly on my experience during the three years before I left my previous institution, McMurry University, which were a particularly tumultuous period.  I include these comments because they bears directly on my contributions to my service contributions at Thomas More.   </p>
        <p>Shortly after McMurry was put on probation by SACS for budgetary reasons, I was appointed by the Administration to the A <ampersand /> S Restructuring Task Force. The Administration had decided to save money by eliminating the positions of Department Chair and reforming the College of Arts <ampersand /> Science into three divisions, each with a Dean and Vice-Dean to manage the departmental duties. This task force was to recommend how the schools should be split. This had some political implications. </p>
        <p>The McMurry University Think Tank (MUTT) was created to be a Task Force comprised of the entire faculty charged with discussing the changes and to come up with improvements that would shrink the budget. This also had significant political implications. </p>
        <p>During this tumultuous time, I was elected by the faculty to Faculty Council and then, by the Council, to Chair the Faculty Council. Unlike TMU, at McMurry Chair of the Faculty and Chair of Faculty Council are two distinct positions.  The subsequent fall, to further improve the budget, a campus-wide Program Review was instituted to determine which departments might need to be eliminated; a result of the recognition that salaries formed the largest portion of the budget.  During all of this, a Speaking and Writing Across the Curriculum Task Force was created to consider the possibility of replacing the English-composition general-education-requirement. Both of these also had significant political implications. </p>
        <p>As this all came to a head, the faculty elected me the Chair of the Faculty, possibly because of my somewhat vocal advocacy on behalf of the faculty during faculty meetings, during committee meetings, and behind the scenes. This role put me back on the Faculty Council, required me to participate in the Campus Budget meetings, represent the faculty to the President, and represent the faculty to the various Vice Presidents.  These experiences colored the way I saw the subsequent events at Thomas More. </p>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="app-charity"><title>Community, Church, and Charity</title>
        <p>You may note some items at the end of <xref ref="prof-vitae" text="title">my CV</xref> that labelled <q>Community</q> and <q>Interests</q>.  The equine-rehabilitation activities are volunteer opportunities that I participated in Texas and for the first few years in Kentucky.  The program I was volunteering at in Kentucky close for a short time and, once I stopped, I found that I had otherwise filled my time when it finally restarted about five years later.  The vintage base ball was also a volunteer activity with the History Department in Texas.  This was not for charity, but rather about community bonding and enrichment.</p>
        <p>When I was in college, I fell away from the church. In later years, my mother tried to convince me to return.  She urged and cajoled and described all the aspects that were meaningful to her, including a sense of community, being part of something larger than yourself, confidence that you are contributing to a mission that is good and right, being remind of how to live well, supporting your fellow citizen, giving selflessly, etc.  She had a longer list, but while we discussed it, it became clearer and clearer to me that academia is to me what the Catholic church is to my mother.  I had not thought about that in a long time, until I read <xref ref="rec-ryle" text="title">Dr. Ryle's recommendation</xref>.  In hindsight, I think that much of the attitude that he describes is due to my relationship to academia and the participants of our community of scholars.  I am devoted to the mission of academia.</p>
